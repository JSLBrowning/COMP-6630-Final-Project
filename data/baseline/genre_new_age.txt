A Day Without Rain
Only Time
Who can say
where the road goes
where the day flows
only time
And who can say
if your love grows
as your heart chose
only time
Who can say
why your heart sighs
as your love flies
only time
And who can say
why your heart cries
when your love lies
only time

Who can say
when the roads meet
that love might be
in your heart
And who can say
when the day sleeps
if the night keeps
all your heart

Night keeps all your heart

Who can say
if your love grows
as your heart chose
only time
And who can say
where the road goes
where the day flows
only time

Who knows - only time
Who knows - only time

May
Hakikat
Sendiri
Dinginnya di malam ini
Suasana pilu 
Terkenang daku kembali 
Sejarah silam

Setelah engkau pergi 
Sepi hati ku
Terpadamlah api cinta
Musnah harapan

Mengapa engkau sanggup
Berubah fikiran
Hanya kerana peristiwa itu
Kau hancurkan kota cinta 
Yang kita bina bersama
Di masa yang lalu

c/o
Kini aku terus terseksa
Oleh kepalsuan cinta mu
Tinggallah aku sendiri
Menanggung derita ini

Setelah engkau pergi
Tertutup hatiku
Tak mungkin bercinta lagi
Biarku sendiri

Watermark (With Translation)
Cursum Perficio

 Cursum perficio.                I am making an end to my course.
 Verbum sapienti:                A word to the wise:
 quo plus habent,                the more [people] have
 eo plus cupiunt.                the more they want.
 Post nubila, Phoebus            After the clouds, Phoebus     (1)
 Iternum                         Over and over again           (2)


Phoebus was one of the names for the Sun god,
which may be more famous as Apollo (Greek).
It is notable that the Sun is a male.
The word 'iternum' does not exist;
it could either be a misspelling for 'eternum' (eternal),
which is unlikely since it is very rare that an adjective
be used as an adverb, or for 'iterum' (again and again)
which is in fact an adverb and makes a little more sense (!!).
The meaning of 'cursum perficio' is actually best explained
by the footnote to the lyrics:
Enya was inspired by these words she saw on Marylin Monroe's
last house, where they were taken to mean "my journey ends here".
It is a rather "free" translation, but it's probably a very good
way to convey the meaning of Latin, which has a way of saying
things that is very distant from modern-day English.
The fact that those words turned out to be prophetical only
adds to the power of the song.

TITLE: The Mess I Made Lyrics
LYRICS:
Should've kissed you there, I should've held your face
I should've watched those eyes instead of run in place
I should've called you out, I should've said your name
I should've turned around, I should've looked again

But oh I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
As you turn you take your heart and walk away

Should've held my ground, I could've been redeemed
For every second chance that changed its mind on me
I should've spoken up, I should've proudly claimed
That oh my head's to blame for all my heart's mistakes

But oh I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
As you turn you take your heart and walk away

And it's you, and it's you
And it's you, and it's you
And it's falling down as you walk away
And it's on me now as you go

But oh I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
As you turn you take your heart and walk away

And it's falling down as you walk away
And it's on me now as you go

But oh I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
I'm staring at the mess I made
As you turn you take your heart and walk away

TITLE: Chip Lyrics
LYRICS:
Chip worked as a boatwright
As his father and his gran
Working in a boatyard
Building on the River Thames
One day Chip was hard at work
The Devil appeared from hell
He held a roll of copper
And a bucket full of nails

The Devil said unto Chip
Take these nails and copper roll
But you also have to take this rat
And I will take your soul
Chip despised the rat
The rat squealed and hissed
But the bucket o' nails and copper
Were too much to resist

Chip went straight to work
He'd get rid of the rat
And there would not be a problem
With his death after the fact
But the devil rat wouldn't die
No matter how hard he tried
The rat attacked the boatwright
And he bit him in the eye

It seemed as if the river rats
Fell under Satan's spell
They followed Chip around
And made his life a living hell
He slowly lost his mind
He lost his family
He lost his job
And had to join the Kings' Navy

A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I'm gonna get you

The rats chased Chip
Up the gangplank of the ship
They bit him and they tortured him
Until he finally flipped
He sniveled to the captain
To turn around the rig
The captain spied his madness
And chucked him in the brig

Now the devil rat had his man
He knew just what to do
He'd command the rats
And through the planks they'd chew
The water rushed in
The ship went down
She was smashed around the rocks
On which the rats danced around

A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you Chip

A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I will get you Chip
A lemon grows a pip
A yard will build a ship
As Satan is my master
I'll get you Chip

Everything that’s alive grows from a tiny seed.
You know the little tomato seeds you and Nancy planted in your garden,
And how they grew into nice, red tomatoes?
Yeah
"Laughter"
Look Dad

Well like this.

Daddy?

Remember how I told you the hen lays an egg?

When the baby grows up to be an old man, and dies,
They bury his body in the ground.
But his soul goes to heaven.

Now look here

Aww I'm bundled,
I got on like two jackes on,
Two pair of pants,
About three socks,
A hat,
I need a mask too cause it's cold.
Real cold.

I've been beaten down, I've been kicked around
But she takes it all for me
And I lost my faith in my darkest days
She makes me want to believe

They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love and she is all I need, she's all I need

Well, I had my ways, they were all in vain
And she waited patiently
It was all the same, all my pride and shame
She put me on my feet

They call her love, love, love, love, love
They call her love, love, love, love, love
She is love and she is all I need
She is love and she is all I need
She is love and she is all I need

Hold on we brave the waves don’t fall
When the sheriff’s got your back against the wall

You can catch us switching lanes at the break of dawn
When the rebel spirit answers to my call
When the magic from within is released reborn
That’s why we crave to conquer all

O o when we come together
No matter the weather
We gonna love each other till the end of time WO O O
Till the end of time WO O O

Are you ready to face the eye of the storm
When the planets are enraged can you stay calm
Will you find your way when you’ve strayed to far
Whether the distance is great or small

I can show you the way if you gaze at the stars
When the universe leaves all the gates ajar
Whether I’ll be there is no question at all
I could not escape the vortex to which we are drawn.

O o when we come together
No matter the weather
We gonna love each other till the end of time WO O O
Till the end of time WO O O

We gonna rock the party automatic we gonna get naughty yeah
We gonna rock it drop it till the morning there’ll be no stopping yeah

It's no lie

She says Adios, says Adios,

she says adieu, says adios, goodbye

He says Adios, says Adios,

there's no moon in her sky

No Goodbyes

Don't say Adios, say Adios,

Of all the money that e'er I spent
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that ever I did
Alas, it was to none but me

And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

If I had money enough to spend
And leisure to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in the town
That sorely has my heart beguiled

Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart enthralled
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Oh, all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay

But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

Uno mas uno son siete
En un anden de la estacion
bajo el sol abrasador
tu hablabas de un rascacielos del 
cielo de nueva york
ventre pontro a ver el mar
y te envia una postal
ya sabia que aquel dia era el final
ahora tengo mucho mas
rojo negro par o impar por fin la suerte trae un as 
y un cristal para mirar
y una pared para colgar
Siete caras sonriendo en una foto de carnet
mis cuentos no hablaban de historias 
hechas de casualidad
nadie me dijo que el destino
daba esta oportunidad
Uno mas uno son siete 
quien me lo iba a decir
que era tan fácil 
ser feliz
cuantos años llevo aqui cuantos me pueden Quedar
cual es el precio exacto de la felicidad
quien se acordara de mi 
quien te volvera a mirar
quien pulsa la manijas de la casualidad
una caricia del hayer unas postales sin firmar
y aquel disco de los Barinet no son cosas que guardar
hoy sonrio al recordar que soñaras con volar
desde los bancos de Madrids no se puede ver el mar
mis cuentos no hablaban de historias 
hechas de casualidad
nadie me dijo que el destino
daba esta oportunidads
Uno mas uno son siete 
quien me lo iba a decir
que era tan fácil 
ser feliz
Si huvo un tiempo para mi ahora es para los seis
esta saliendo el café 
otra vez comienza el lio como cada amanecer
hay tostadas para tres 
arreglar la habitación
este cuadro de familia se merece una canción
mis cuentos no hablaban de historias 
hechas de casualidad
nadie me dijo que el destino 
daba esta oportunidad
Uno mas uno son siete 
quien me lo iba a decir
que era tan fácil 
ser feliz
SER FELIZ

TITLE: Drink Some More Lyrics
LYRICS:
Like a squid, up at dawn
An' I drag me butt tae me job.
Not a break, front to back
Kicking balls to the wall
Down a mile a hole
Moving mountains of coal
While here's to hell
It's ringing my bell
Sing a song, bang a gong
And tonight would be good to be bad.

So I take a wee dram
Just to take off the edge
Whether diggin' a ditch
Or swinging a sledge
I drink to ignore high society's crap.
Bot'tla' whiskey in me
And I ain't even whacked
Now I know how it feels for the rat
On the wheel to run for the cheese.

We drink and we drink and we drink some more
The only thing better than drinking for me
Is when I'm drinking with you
and we're drinking for free.

I feel drunk and tight
Just a wee bit tipsy tonight
It's the best that I've had
But I've puked on my kilt
Will you call me a cab
Will you call me a cab
For now I must go
To wake up at dawn
For a heave and a hoe
And tonight was good to be bad

TITLE: Broken From The Start Lyrics
LYRICS:
Life is a gift like fresh cut roses
Cut from the branch and brought inside
It's a slow contradiction, it's beauty in a vase
When our cords are cut that's when we start to die

Lately death and life get so confusing
I can't tell the difference here tonight
But lately every breath feels like I'm kissing death
And when time is dead I cease to be alive

If you hide yourself deep inside, deep inside
In time you've got nothing left to hide, there's nothing left inside
Tonight honey I'm gonna break your heart
Mine was broken from the start, broken from the start

Choice is the only thing we're given
For one to live another dies
One road says hello, the other says goodbye
And the rose that you don't choose begin to die

If you hide yourself deep inside, deep inside
In time you've got nothing left to hide, it dries up inside
Tonight honey I'm gonna break your heart
Mine was broken from the start, broken from the start
Broken from the start, broken from the start

They won't pay a cent to hear you laughing
They might pay a little to hear you cry
If you do it long enough they might even pay attention
But they still won't pay respect until you die, die

If you hide yourself deep inside, deep inside
In time you've got nothing left to hide, it's all dead inside
Tonight honey I'm gonna break your heart
Mine was broken from the start, broken from the start

If I Should Fall From Grace With God
Fairytale Of New York
It was Christmas Eve babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me, won't see another one
And then he sang a song
The Rare Old Mountain Dew
And I turned my face away
And dreamed about you

Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So happy Christmas
I love you baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars
Big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old

When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me

You were handsome
You were pretty
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on the corner
Then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing
Out for Christmas day

You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Living there almost dead on a drip
In that bed

You scum bag
You maggot
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God
It's our last

I could have been someone
So could anyone
You took my dreams
From me when I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you
