[** feat. Frank Reyes:]


Ya yo no veo
El hombre aquel
Aquel divino
Ya ni recuerdas
Ni los momentos
Lo que vivimos
Donde se fue
Y dime amor si es que ella pudo mas que yo
Si te fui fiel corazon
Es que ella pudo mas que yo

Son las cosas de la vida
No me pidas una explicacion
Comensemos desde zero 
Nuestro amor esta primero
Y sabes que es tuyo mi corazon
Por el bien de los dos
Luchemos por nuestro amor
Contra la tentasion
Amandonos
Te pido perdon
Rescatemos nuestra historia de amor

Amoor amoor
Me marchitas y me irritas ven
Devuelveme la vida
(Te pido perdon)
Tu y yo nos juramos
Que algun dia nadie esto romperia
Amoor amoor
Dime que no pudo mas que yo
(Tu eres mi reina mi amor)
Amoor amoor
Dime que ella no es mejor que yo

(Soy yo tu principe)
(Frank reyes)

Tu eres la mujer
De mi vida
La que yo quiero
Pero le asemos tanto da~o al amor
Y descuidamos los detalles mas peque~os
No... que el dolor
Se acomode hay en tu corazon
Lo enfrentare
Con valor
Dime cual asido nuestro error

El trabajo la casa
Las deudas que pasan
Que no... mi rey mi corazon
No me sonries como antes
Se muy bien quien es tu amante
Dimelo no te acobardes porfavor
No seas tonto no te dejes
Si lo nuestro es mas grande
Y si yo agarro a tu amante no respondo
Ya te veo tragando ondo
Se muy bien que es un trastorno
Pero en esto llego al fondo corazon

Son las cosas de la vida
No me pidas una explicacion
Comensemos desde zero
Nuestro amor esta primero
Y sabes que es tuyo mi corazon
Por el bien de los dos
Luchemos por nuestro amor
Contra la tentasion
Amandonos
Te pido perdon
Rescatemos nuestra historia de amor

Amoor amoor
Me marchitas y me irritas ven
Devuelveme la vida
(Te pido perdon)
Tu y yo nos juramos
Que algun dia nadie esto romperia
Amoor amoor
Dime que no pudo mas que yo
(Tu eres mi reina mi amor)
Amoor amoor
Dime que ella no es mejor que yo
(Tu eres y seras la unica mujer en mi vida)

LYRICS:
I said I don't want to walk this earth
If I got to do it solo

See, girl we used to be a team, running the streets
Yeah, we was living out our dream, oh
You used to be my rider, I was your provider
Now we separated in two

Oh and baby, you left and sailed away alone
(Yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
Where nowhere to get home

And I don't wanna go, go, I don't wanna go, girl
I don't wanna it, no, no, I don't wanna it, no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo
(Solo)

'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
And I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
(Solo)

You was the beat unto my top line
Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again

Oh, when we was burning up the airways
They know us from the Virgin Islands to the UK
See, we was on our way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go but you did, yeah, you did

Oh and baby, you left and sailed away alone
(Yeah, alone)
And now you got me trapped up on this island
Where nowhere to get home

And I don't wanna go, go, I don't wanna go, girl
I don't wanna it, no, no, I don't wanna it, no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo
(Solo)

'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
And I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo
(Solo)

I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O
Oh no, oh no
(Oh no, oh no)
I don't wanna walk S-O-L-O

And I don't wanna go, go, I don't wanna go, girl
I don't wanna it, no, no, I don't wanna it, no, no
I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo
(Solo)

'Cause I was so high and now I'm so low
And I don't wanna walk around alone, solo
And I don't want to walk this earth
If I gotta do it solo, solo

Dime,dime,dime,dime,dime,dime
Dime como hago yo, para sacarte de mi mente y de mi alma
si tu no te quieres ir.
Ohh pero dime si tu me has podido olvidar
Ya no mientas se te nota en la mirada
Tus ojos no mienten ya
Ohhh corazon que es lo que has echo?
Un dolor aqui en mi pecho
La angustia me esta matando
El tiempo sigue pasando
Y yo no se yo no lo se si tu fallaste oh yo falle
Te busque y no te encontre y esta vez te pedire
Quedate quedate conmigo corazon
No enganemos nuestras vidas
Encontremos las salidas
No vivamos las mentiras
Sabes bien que soy tu vida
Amor, vivir sin tus caricias es una maldicion
Todos rien la derrota, carcajadas en sus bocas y quien sufre y se alimenta somos tu y yo
Dime, dime como hago corazon
Para sacarte de mi mente y de mi alma si tu no te quieres ir.
Ohhh pero dime, dime si has podido olvidar
No me mientas se te nota en la mirada tus ojos no mienten ya.

[Verse 1: LL Cool J + (Wayne Wonder)]
I remember when I had that little shorty uptown
In the drop we would never stop runnin around
She would lay up in the condo I was a clown
Everytime the phone rang I ignored the sound (Whoa oooh whoa oooh whoa!!!)
You would cry up on the doorstep stomp and pound
Throwin up hysterical you fell on the ground
I chose lust over love, as foul as it sounds
But that was then and this is now ([LL:] Uh huh uh huh)

[Wayne Wonder + (LL Cool J)]
Got somebody (Remix baby) she is a beauty (LL baby)
Very special (Dutchess baby) really and truly (Wayne Wonder baby)
Takes good care of me, like it's her duty

Cuando me toques dire que estoy bien cansada
Que trabaje del dia hasta la madrugada

En tu carro montare a mi combo son mas de setenta

A tu amante las gracias por tu ausencia

LYRICS:
He recibido una llamada Me dijeron que te vieron*
No quiero peros tampoco celos
Guarda tu escena no me des excusas pa
No voy a escuchar asÃ­ que cÃ¡lmala

Ya lo se todo me dijeron de ella
Me dijeron su vida En verdad me dan pena
Si tu te crees que con mis brazos
Cruzados yo me quedare

Me miro al espejo
Me peino y me maquillo
Un vestido corto sabes lo que te digo
Me montare en mi carro Por que se su direcciÃ³n
Que aguante presiÃ³n de este mujeron!

Hola! atrevida yo te traigo una noticia
Por eso es mi sonrisa Te la dare sin prisa
El hombre con quien sales Es mÃ­o y tÃº lo sabes!
Pero aqui esta el detalle en la cama no vale...

Por eso vine a felicitarte
De lo que me libraste
Y tengo que confesarte
Mientras toman su tiempo
Yo a alguien lo estoy viendo
Un hombre de verdad y no la basura que yo tengo

La vida es asÃ­
Si la sobras de otra te hace a ti feliz
AquÃ­ esta el detalle
Yo te lo regalo por todo el sufrimiento
Y el dano que a causado

La vida es asÃ­
Ahora grito a viva voz que con alguien soy feliz
Alguien que me consiente
Me trata diferente me lleva de su mano y
Me dice lo que siente

Guarda tus escusas que yo tengo otra
Te callare la boca y coge lo que te toca
Lo Que aqui se hace se tiene que pagar
No me distes mi lugar no tienes que regresar

Tengo alguien que me ama al fiiin...
Yo tengo quien me toque a miii...
Alguien que me merece y que su amor me crece
Me hace sentir grande alguien que por mi rece

Alguien que me ama al fin...
Yo tengo quien me toque a miii...
AquÃ­ esta el detalle Si no cuidas lo tuyo
Otro llegara y la harÃ¡ sentir suyo

No quiero peros tampoco celos [x4]

AsÃ­ que cÃ¡lmala [x4]

He recibido una llamada Me dijeron que te vieron
No quiero peros tampoco celos
Guarda tu escena no me des excusas pa
No voy a escuchar asÃ­ que cÃ¡lmala

AsÃ­ que cÃ¡lmala [x4]

Just in case you never know

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I doh wanna play games, no games, ohh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight
No games, ohh

We've been together 6 months now
(The most perfect days)
You pushed for us to exchange vows
(Baby, changed my ways)

I gave my life over to you
And you turned around
After all that we've been through
I was your rebound

Girl, I want you
(All time)
I'll forever love you
(You're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad
('Cause you)
Should give me one more chance

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I doh wanna play games, no games, ohh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight
No games, ohh

Is this the life you really want
(Constant delusion)
Your time with me was very fun
(There's no illusion)
But I don't know you anymore
When you walked outside that door
You left your rep yea

Girl, I want you
(All time)
I'll forever love you
(You're mine)
I'm not mad even though I'm sad
('Cause you)
Should give me one more chance

Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I doh wanna play games, no games, ohh
You're the only that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight

LYRICS:
So many different flavors, so many shapes and sizes
You coming with me and you going where Iyaz
No surprises, I put it all on the table for you
Nothing is too taboo, I'm ready, willing to give you everything

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm trying to pick the right one, I'm trying to pick the right one
Trying to find a shorty to hold me down

They say to get to a New York girl
Then you gotta have a lot of class
And I heard there ain't nothing like a Cali girl
But you better have a lot of cash

And I know there ain't nothing like the A-Town girl
'Cause they know how to show you love
And no matter where I go I gotta let them know
That this song here is about you

See, I don't mean to run away to places you would not believe
Seeing all those pretty gals and wishing you were there with me
The simple way you smile girl it tells me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm trying to pick the right one, I'm trying to pick the right one
Trying to find a shorty to hold me down

Tell me is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?

They say to get a MIA girl
Then you gotta have a lot of swag
I heard to get a down south belle
Then you gotta ride a Cadillac

And I know ain't nothin' like a London girl
'Cause they know how to party, oh
And no matter where I go I gotta let 'em know
That this song here is about you

See, I don't mean to run away to places you would not believe
Seeing all those pretty girls and wishing you were there with me
The simple way you smile girl it tells me all I need to know
You can be my one and only

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna to pick the right one, I'm tryna to pick the right one
Tryna to find a shorty to hold me down

Tell me is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?

I'm so indecisive
Trying to find a pretty girl that these shoes goes nice with
Been around the world and back, got a knack for them girls in black
But I need a chick that's gonna hold me tight like vice grips

Just make sure you need my heart how you found it
You can keep the key but the lock stays around it
Baby, let's take it slow, no pulling a fast one
And you look like the type to keep my mind off the last one

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this city

I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one
I'm tryna to pick the right one

There's a lot of pretty girls in this city
There's a lot of pretty girls in this town
I'm tryna to pick the right one, I'm tryna to pick the right one
Tryna to find a shorty to hold me down

Tell me is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?
Is it you, girl?

LYRICS:
Cuando no importan las palabras*
Cuando no importan los amigos
Y cuando tÃº te encuentres solo
Y analices que todo ya lo abras perdido
Cuando no allÃ¡ nadie quien te escuche discutir
Cuando en tu cama ya no puedas ni dormir,
Que dando vueltas te parezca el fin,
Que no allÃ¡ nadie que se acuerde de ti
Cuando no tengas a quien darle una sonrisa
Cuando en tu cuerpo ya no hay una caricia
En las maÃ±anas te levantes tan deprisa
Cuando tu sol se nuble y no sople la brisa
Cuando tu entiendas que el orgullo es el que habla sin parar
Es el que jura la mujer vive de la necesidad
Cuando despiertes de ese sueÃ±o y enfrentes la realidad
Te pasaran los aÃ±os en vanos por tu no saber amar
Lo que es amar, lo que es querer, lo es llorar
A una mujer, a una mujer

Cuando recuerdes la historia de AdÃ¡n y Eva
Que fue capaz de renunciar todo por ella
Cuando te hablen de amores como el de Celia
Que junto a Pedro llego y toco las estrellas
Y hasta pecar y morir solo por una pasiÃ³n
Que hasta su lado continuar y todo por eso es amor
Cuando tÃº entiendas que el hombre es el que no usa la razÃ³n es el que usa en la maldad y jamÃ¡s usa el corazÃ³n
Es el que habla y no escucha que no coge lucha
Dice mujeres hay muchas
Es que se olvido para amar solo son dos
Una arma gemela y yo el amor igual que crece
Te marchita el corazÃ³n
Cuando tu aprendas que perdiste lo hermoso de la vida
Lo que se ama no se olvida se te abrirÃ¡ una herida
Y aprenderÃ¡s lo que es querer lo que es amar a una mujer a una mujer a una mujer
A una mujer

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na everyday
It's like my iPod's stuck on replay, replay

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singin' like
Na, na, na, na everyday
It's like my iPod's stuck on replay, replay

Remember the first time we met
You was at the mall with your friend
I was scared to approach you
But then you came closer
Hopin' you would give me a chance

Who would have ever knew
That we would ever be more than friends
We're real worldwide, breakin' all the rules
She like a song played again and again

That girl like somethin' off a poster
That girl is a dime they say
That girl is a gun to my holster
She's runnin' through my mind all day, hey

Shawty's like a melody in my head

Not once did you leave my mind
We talk on the phone
From night till the morn
Girl, you really change my life

Doin' things I never do
I'm in the kitchen' cookin' things she likes
We're real worldwide, breakin' all the rules
Someday I wanna make you my wife

The one that could fill your fantasies
So come, baby girl, let's sing with me, hey

Remix baby!!! remix baby!!! come on come on!!! remix baby!!! (Rock the bells baby)
Come on come on!!! (Wayne Wonder, LL, Queen Dutchess, official remix) uh! uh!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J + (Wayne Wonder)]
I remember when I had that little shorty uptown
In the drop we would never stop runnin around
She would lay up in the condo I was a clown
Everytime the phone rang I ignored the sound (Whoa oooh whoa oooh whoa!!!)
You would cry up on the doorstep stomp and pound
Throwin up hysterical you fell on the ground
I chose lust over love, as foul as it sounds
But that was then and this is now ([LL:] Uh huh uh huh)

[Wayne Wonder + (LL Cool J)]
Got somebody (Remix baby) she is a beauty (LL baby)
Very special (Dutchess baby) really and truly (Wayne Wonder baby)
Takes good care of me, like it's her duty

Want you right by my side (Online now, online now) night and day
(Give me the dance now, bust the dance now)

[Chorus: Wayne Wonder + (LL Cool J)]
No letting go no holding back

[Verse 2: Queen Dutchess]
I knew this was more than a crush (Crush) more than a bust
It had to be much more in storage for us (Us)
And we got a sea coast gettin live on the speed boat
It's like the sea go wherever we go (We go)
We made it now and I'm just glad to be able to let all the fables drown
So you can have more than a piece of my love

Really appreciate you lovin me (Your by my side the whole time baby)
All time, tiiiiime!!! (Let me finish the story for you check it)

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She caught me in the crib with her I was a fool
That's a major violation baby that wasn't cool
Beyond my manly pride deep down I knew
I was born to spend my life with you cause you were true (True)
So I held you in my arms real tight (Uh)
Made a valent guard that I would treat you right
I realize now it ain't all about ice
You wan't a good man in your life (I understand baby)

LYRICS:
Welcome to the drama song*
La reina de este movimeinto
The queen
Esta es para ti de parte mia

Estoy cansada de lo que me haces sentir
Aburrida, de que me hagas infeliz
Pero no por mucho mi amor
No te queda mucho tiempo
Yo te lo vengo diciendo
Que cuando una mujer se cansa se va corriendo y...

Busca lo que no hay en casa
Busca lo que ya no tiene
Mientras tu sigues la trasas
Sabe que no le convienes
Yo te lo vengo a ti diciendo
Prestame atencion
Llegamos al final del cuento
Y tu juego se acabÃ³

Cada vez que tu me miras mi cara voy a voltear
Cada vez que tu me llames no te voy a contestar no...
Pa que sepas que se siente
Lo que es ser un ignorante
Tu que te guillas de gante
Pero pero, no te quiero quiero

Te lo advertÃ­a y tu ni caso me hacias
Mira que ironia y eso que la culpa es mia
Lagrimas por ti mejor lloro a la madre mia
Por no hacer caso a lo que me decia
Poco hombre no ha nacido quien me asombre
Todos comienzan bien y en el camino se tuercen
Todos juran amor pero a la larga te mienten
Aora dime papi como se siente

Cada vez que tu me miras mi cara voy a voltear
Cada vez que tu me llames no te voy a contestar no...
Pa que sepas que se siente
Lo que es ser un ignorante
Tu que te guillas de gante
Pero pero, no te quiero quiero

Estoy cansada de lo que me haces sentir
Aburrida, de que me hagas infeliz
Pero te lo juro mi amor
No te queda mucho tiempo
Yo te lo vengo diciendo
Que cuando una mujer se cansa se va corriendo

Se va corriendo
Yo te lo vengo diciendo
El final del cuento
Yo me voy corriendo

Cada vez que tu me miras mi cara voy a voltear
Cada vez que tu me hables no te voy a contestar no...
Pa que sepas que se siente
Lo que es ser un ignorante
Tu que te guillas de gante
Pero pero, no te quiero quiero

Estoy cansada de lo que me haces sentir
Aburrida, de que me hagas infeliz
Pero te lo juro mi amor
No te queda mucho tiempo
Yo te lo vengo diciendo
Que cuando una mujer se cansa se va corriendo

Se va corriendo
Se va corriendo
El final del cuento
Eso es asi papa
Este drama es de la vida real

LYRICS:
Un dia cai de rodilla pediendole a Dios*
Jamas pensar en ti...
Con lagrimas en la mejilla yo le pedi...
Tenga piedad de mi...

Llegaste como una ola
Y Tu imagen se apodero de mi
De que me vale correr
Si mi mente de ahi no quiere salir

Antes de que salga corriendo yo...
Necesito saber por que razon
No te puedo sacar de mi corazon

Me contestaron

Que el amor es tan fuerte y hiere
En pedazo te destroza y dueleee
Que el amor
A veces es una falsa
Y cuando llega te atrapa
Se comete los errores y faltas
Y te ata

El amor que es puro no hiere
No discute no te tumba
No duele...

Ay de mi pobre corazon
No te engaÃ±es mas que eso duele
Despierta y nooo...
No llores
Ay de mi no me ignores mas
Hasme caso te tas matando
Despiertaa y tu...
Te mueres...

Para que amar si te va doler
Para que mentir si se va a saber
Para que entregarlo todo... por el
Para que fingir algo que no esta
Te va destrozar no podras aguantarlo
El amor que a ti te abusa es cruel...

El amor que es puro no hiere
No discute, no te tumba
No duele...

Antes de que salga corriendo yo...
Debo proteger a mi corazon...
Que es fragil
Ante que te te engaÃ±en
Y te hagan pedazoos
Debo yo guardarte de los fracasos
Y no es facil...

El amor yeah, el amor si
El amor... que es puro no hiere

El amor yeah, el amor si
El amor... no te engaÃ±es duelee

El amor que es puro no hiere
No discute no te tumba
No duele...

Eso es asi sobre toda cosa guardada
Guarda tu corazon yeahh

LYRICS:
OOhhhh I love you (2x)

Baby boy you never know
when you left my heart was gone
and I know I give my own to you
Baby boy it's hard to show
see your pictures on my wall
and I feel like dying slow by you

Baby, baby please take time
to say good bye and I know that pride
is bigger on your side

Can't eat, can't sleep, can't feel
can't breathe no more, no more
just remember the day we meet
you took my breath away
so fine, so slowly

No, I don't want to left this feeling go
so this is my song

(CORO)
So "ladies", if you know better
si el hombre te quiere
dejalo que volvera
"My fellows" si tu la quieres
nada te detiene
sal corriendo y buscala (2x)

I feel sorry that you make me cry
I don't lie, love is blind
Pero es tan lindo junto a ti
Es que puedo seguir,
Es que puedo vivir

Las memorias de tu adios,
no las borro, no las toco
y lo sabremos tu y yo corazon
listen to my song, mi amor

dicen que los hombres no deben llorar
y no deben mostrar sensibilidad

Pero nosotras las mujeres
cuando amamos somos fieles...

(CORO)
So "ladies", if you know better
si el hombre te quiere
dejalo que volvera
"My fellows" si tu la quieres
nada te detiene
sal corriendo y buscala ...

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes I do mi amor, I LOVE YOU, Yes I do

LYRICS:
I remember days when we were younger
We used to catch 'o'opu in the mountain stream
'Round the Ko'olau hills we'd ride on horseback
So long ago it seems it was a dream
Last night I dreamt I was returning
and my heart called out to you
But I fear you won't be like I left you
Me kealoha ku'u home o Kahaluu

I remember days when we were wiser
When our world was small enough for dreams
And you have lingered there my sister
And I no longer can it seems
Last night I dreamt I was returning
and my heart called out to you
But I fear you won't be like I left you
Me kealoha ku'u home o Kahaluu

Change is a strange thing
it cannot be denied
It can help you find yourself
or make you lose your pride
Move with it slowly
as on the road we go
Please do not hold on to me
we all must go alone

I remember days when we were smiling
When we laughed and sang the whole night long
And I will greet you as I find you
With the sharing of a brand new song
Last night I dreamt I was returning
and my heart called out to you
To please accept me as you'll find me
Me kealoha ku'u home o Kahaluu

Subterranean Homesick Blues
(As for those) in the basement
(Marijuanaâs) the medicine
(And those) on the pavement
(Burning down the false) government
The man in the trench coat
Badge out, laid off
Says heâs got a bad cough
Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid
Itâs something you did
(Jah) knows when
But youâre doinâ it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookinâ for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap
In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills
You only got ten

Maggie comes fleet foot
Face full of black soot
Talkinâ that the heat put
Plants in the bed but
The phoneâs tapped anyway
Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A.
Look out kid
Donât matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes
Donât try âNo Dozâ
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose
Watch (those) plain clothes
You donât need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows

(You) get sick, (then) get well
Hang around an ink well
(Things fell), hard to tell
If anything is goinâ to sell
Try hard, get barred
Get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail
(Donât stop, you donât) fail
Look out kid
Youâre gonna get hit
By users, cheaters
Six-time losers
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool
Lookinâ for a new fool
Donât follow leaders
Watch the parkinâ meters

Ah get born, keep warm
(Girls come) learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed
Try to be a success
Please her (to please me)
Donât steal, donât (shop) lift
Twenty years of schoolinâ
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid
They keep it all hid
(You come out from the dark zone)
Light yourself a (fire torch)
Wear (your) sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Donât wanna be a bum
(Get yourself a gun)
The pump donât work
âCause the vandals took the handles

And I belong making this song for those young

I express my undying love for you allâ¦
Keep rising so, anticipating to let you know
All Jah love, is all for you, let you know

Love you for who you are, and He knows what you are
âCause love is good, and hatred is so bad
Love you for who you are, and not what you have
âCause love is good, and hatred that is so bad

Dirty heart people ya canât make me weak
Emperor Selassie-I me pray you haffe see it
Umm, bless the prophet, bless the King, bless the priest
And bless up all the strifing youths inna the street
Oh Rastafari love we show, yes Rastafari words we know
All my life, Iâm gonna tell you so

Love you for who you are, and not what you have
âCause love is so good, and hatred that is so bad
Love you for who you are, and not what you have
âCause hatred is so badâ¦

Now when you a beam then you better off
When youâre pure and clean then youâre better off
Ites, gold and green, then youâre better off
Man a free, black supreme, yes Selassie-I
with HIM African Queen

Babylon is satan torch them a carry
Poor people innocent blood them a carry
Hand crop, jail, and club them a carry
Tell I pull black manâs vote, itâs drugs them a carry
When there is black love we a carry

Their privacy, is the sizzle-rance love dem carry
All dayâ¦ and them a trouble nobody
Watch out, Babylon canât tarry
Love you for who you are, and not what you have

âCause love is so good, and hatred that is so bad
Love you for who you are, and not what you have
âCause love is so good, and hatred that is so bad

Woah yeah! So you better offâ¦
When you clean and pure, then youâre better off
When you stand up and you pure, then youâre better off
When you love Jah Jah more, then youâre better off
Righteousness fe ya core, then youâre better off
When you live up really high, then youâre better off
When ya praise Selassie-I then youâre better off
Burn them Pharisees and burn them spite in oil

And I love you for who you are, and not what you have
âCause love is so good, and hatred that is so bad

Dirty heart people canât stop me from strive
Oh Rastafari open up our eyes
Woah yeah, them never can disguise firelight

Love you for who you are, and not what you have
âCause love is so good, and hatred that is so bad

Ghetto youths say you know, so you better off
When youâre pure and clean, then youâre better off
And you reign black supreme haffe better off
Ites, gold and green, then youâre better off
Rasta love that run the scheme, bet youâre better off
King Selassie and a rebel, then youâre better off
When you burn out the devil, then youâre better off
Make some music and bounce âpon the bass and the treble

Love you for who you are, and not what you have
Love is so good, remember that hatred that is so bad
Love you for who you are, and He knows what you areâ¦

Miscellaneous
Anything You Want
It's hard to explain
The hardships and pain
That true lovers must endure
That's for sure
I have my regrets
But much more than that
This special love we must secure
More and more

There's no better feelin'
Than when I rise up to see the morning sun
And watch the sunrise in you eyes
You're like the summer breeze
When I'm going through my winter time
So baby take this love of mine

'Cause anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will be so true
Anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true to you

They say once you're bit, you're twice as shy
I have no reason to ask you why, why oh why
We must understand the ultimate plan
Is that we live a happy life
In the by and by

There's no better feelin'
Than when I rise up to see the morning sun
And watch the sunrise in you eyes
You're like the summer breeze
That comes to me in the winter time
So honey, I hope you realize

'Cause anything you want, girl
I will give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true
Anything you want, girl
I will surely give it to you
Anything you need, girl
My heart will always be true to you
