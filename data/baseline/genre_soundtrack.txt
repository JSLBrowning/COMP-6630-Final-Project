LYRICS:
Your grace is enough, more than I need
At Your word I will believe
I wait for You, draw near again
Let Your Spirit make me new

And I will fall at Your feet
I will fall at Your feet
And I will worship You here

Your presence in me, Jesus light the way
By the power of Your word
I am restored, I am redeemed
By Your Spirit I am free

And I will fall at Your feet
I will fall at Your feet
And I will worship You here, oh Lord

Freely You gave it all for us
Surrendered Your life upon that cross
Great is the love poured out for all
This is our God

Lifted on high from death to life
Forever our God is glorified
Servant and King rescued the world
This is our God

And I will fall at Your feet
We sing I will fall at Your feet
And I will worship You here

And I will fall at Your feet
I will fall at Your feet
And I will worship You here

Freely You gave it all for us
Surrendered Your life upon that cross
Great is the love poured out for all
This is our God

Lifted on high from death to life
Forever our God is glorified
Servant and King rescued the world

TITLE: Stronger Lyrics
LYRICS:
There is love that came for us
Humbled to a sinner's cross
You broke my shame and sinfulness
You rose again victorious

Faithfulness none can deny
Through the storm and through the fire
There is truth that sets me free
Jesus Christ who lives in me

You are stronger, You are stronger
Sin is broken, You have saved me
It is written, Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all

No beginning and no end
You're my hope and my defense
You came to seek and save the lost
You paid it all upon the cross

You are stronger, You are stronger
Sin is broken, You have saved me
It is written, Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all
There is none

So let Your name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher, be lifted higher
So let Your name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher, be lifted higher

So let Your name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher, be lifted higher
So let Your name be lifted higher
Be lifted higher, be lifted higher

You are stronger, You are stronger
Sin is broken, You have saved me
It is written, Christ is risen
Jesus You are Lord of all

You are stronger, You are stronger

I have a dream, a song to sing
To help me cope with anything
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale
You can take the future even if you fail
I believe in angels

Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

I have a dream, a fantasy
To help me through reality
And my destination makes it worth the while
Pushing through the darkness still another mile
I believe in angels

Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream

TITLE: Like Incense/Sometimes By Step Lyrics
LYRICS:
[Verse 1:]
May my prayer like incense rise before You*
The lifting of my hands a sacrifice
Oh Lord Jesus turn Your eyes upon me
For I know there is mercy in Your sight

Your statutes are my heritage forever
My heart is set on keeping your decrees
So still my anxious urge toward rebellion
And let love keep my will on its knees

[Chorus:]
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You
Oh God, You are my God
And I will ever praise You

[Verse 2:]
To all creation I can see a limit
But Your commands are boundless and have none
So Your Word is my joy and meditation
From the rising to the setting of the sun

All Your ways are loving and are faithful
The road is narrow but Your burden light
Because You gladly lean to lead the humble
I shall gladly kneel to leave my pride

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Selah:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I will seek You in the morning
I will learn to walk in Your ways
And step by step You'll lead me
And I will follow You all of my days

TITLE: Woke Up This Morning Lyrics
LYRICS:
You woke up this morning, got yourself a gun
Mama always said you'd be the chosen one
She said, "You're one in a million, you've got to burn to shine
But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes"

You woke up this morning, all the love has gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong
But you're looking good, baby, I believe you're feeling fine
(Shame about it)
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

You woke up this morning, the world turned upside down
Thing's ain't been the same since the blues walked into town
But you're one in a million, you've got that shotgun shine
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

When you woke up this morning everything you had was gone
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes
Like a voice telling you there was something you should know

Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if you'll ever know
The meaning of things as they appear to the others
Wives, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers

Don't you wish you didn't function, wish you didn't think
Beyond the next paycheck and the next little drink
Well, you do so make up your mind to go on
'Cos when you woke up this morning everything you had was gone

When you woke up this morning, when you woke up this morning
When you woke up this morning, mama said you'd be the chosen one
When you woke up this morning, when you woke up this morning
When you woke up this morning, you got yourself a gun

If my heart has grown cold, there Your love will unfold
As You open my eyes to the work of Your hand
When I'm blind to my way, there Your Spirit will pray

TITLE: The Winner Takes It All Lyrics
LYRICS:
I don't want to talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me
Now it's history

I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done too
Nothing more to say
No more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The loser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense
Building me a fence

Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool
Playing by the rules

The Gods may throw the dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear

The winner takes it all
The loser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain?

Tell me, does she kiss?
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same?
When she calls your name?

Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But, what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide
The likes of me abide
Spectators of the show
Always staying low

The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

I don't want to talk
'Cos it makes me feel sad
And I understand
You've come to shake my hand

I apologize
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense
No self-confidence, but you see

The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

The game is on again
A lover or a friend
A big thing or a small
The winner takes it all

The winner takes it all
