LYRICS:
Echoes start as a cross in you
Trembling noises that come too soon
Spatial movement which seems to near
Resonating a mask of fear
Hollow talk and a hollow gain
Force it out for the root of pain
Never said it was good, never said it was near
Shadow rises when you are here
And then you cut
You cut it up
And everything
Goes back to the beginning

Silence seizes a crowded room
Light is shed not a breath too soon
Darkness rises and all you do
Is tighten your jaw and then cross the room
Spatial movements are born of light
Shadows scatter without a fight
It has never been bad there has always been truth
Muted whisper the things you do
And then you cut
You cut it up
And everything
Goes back to the beginning
Never said it was good, never said it was near
Muted whisper the things you feel

I'm a coward too
You don't need to hide my friend
For I am just like you

And now, Wakko Warner
With the 50 US states and their capitals

Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Indianapolis, Indiana
And Columbus is the capital of Ohio
There's Montgomery, Alabama, south of Helena, Montana
Then there's Denver, Colorado, under Boise, Idaho

Texas has Austin, then we go north
To Massachusetts, Boston and Albany, New York
Tallahassee, Florida and Washington, D.C.
Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Nashville, Tennessee

Elvis used to hang out there a lot, ya know

Trenton's in New Jersey north of Jefferson, Missouri
You got Richmond in Virginia, South Dakota has Pierre
Harrisburg's in Pennsylvania and Augusta's up in Maine
And here is Providence, Rhode Island, next to Dover, Delaware

Concord, New Hampshire, just a quick jaunt
To Montpelier, which is up in Vermont

And Kansas has Topeka, Minnesota has St. Paul

Juneau's in Alaska and there's Lincoln in Nebraska
And it's Raleigh out in North Carolina
And then there's Madison, Wisconsin
And Olympia in Washington, Phoenix, Arizona

And Annapolis in Maryland on Chesapeake Bay

And perhaps you make your home in
Salt Lake City out in Utah
Where the Buffalo roam

Atlanta's down in Georgia
And there's Bismarck, north Dakota
And you can live in Frankfort
In your old Kentucky home

Salem in Oregon, from there we join, Little Rock in Arkansas

LYRICS:
Come on now, can we talk about it
Like we used to talk about?
Hotel in the hills with a carousel
Farmhouse in the front, a tractor in the lounge

Oh, oh, oh, honey, I need you 'round
I know, I know

Listen now, can we talk in love
And walk the town? Be easy now
Go hiking through the hills in a summer gown
Raise the kids, peace within and make our sound

Hear me now, I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak without you
So please baby, please give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand until the end
A million times, a trillion more

Oh, oh, oh, honey, I need you 'round
I know, I know

Smile, baby, don't cry
I will only fly with you by my side

Baby, I'm cornered now
Baby, don't push me out
Lately I walk in doubt
Maybe it's crashing down
Baby, can you save it now?

Oh, oh, oh, honey, I need you 'round
I know, I know
Oh, oh, oh, honey, I need you 'round
I know, I know

Baby, I'm cornered now
Baby, don't push me out
Lately I walk in doubt
Maybe it's crashing down

Baby, I'm cornered now
Baby, don't push me out
Lately I walk in doubt
Maybe it's crashing down

Gotta keep
One jump ahead of the breadline
One swing ahead of the sword
I steal only what I can't afford that's everything

One jump ahead of the lawmen
That's all and that's no joke
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke
Riffraff street rat

Scoundrel take that just a little snack, guys
Rip him open, take it back, guys
I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
You're my only friend, Abu

Who? Oh, it's sad, Aladdin's hit the bottom
He's become a one man rise in crime
I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat

Tell you all about it when I got the time
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

One jump ahead of the hitmen
One hit ahead of the flock
I think I'll take a stroll around the block
Stop, thief, Vandal outrage scandal

Let's not be too hasty
Still I think he's rather tasty
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
Otherwise we'd get along

Wrong
One jump ahead of the hoofbeats
(Vandal)
One hop ahead of the hump
(Street rat)
One trick ahead of disaster
(Scoundrel)

They're quick, but I'm much faster
(Take that)
Here goes, better throw my hand in
Wish me happy landin' all I gotta do is jump

If I had a voice I would sing

Dangling feet from window frame

Crushed and filled with all I found

Just to come around

Memory come when memory's old
I am never the first to know
Following the stream up north
Where do people like us float

There is room in my lap
For bruises, asses, hand claps
I will never disappear
For forever I'll be here

Whispering 
Morning keep the streets empty for me
Morning keep the streets empty for me

I'm laying down eating snow
My fur is hot, my tongue is cold
On a bed of spider web
I think of how to change myself

A lot of hope in a one man tent
There's no room for innocence 
So take me home before the storm
Velvet moths will keep us warm

Whispering
Morning keep the streets empty for me 
Morning keep the streets empty for me

Whispering 
Morning keep the streets empty for me
Morning keep the streets empty for me

Uncover our heads and reveal our souls
We were hungry before we were born (x4)

Make way for Prince Ali
Say hey! It's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old Bazaar
Hey you!
Let us through!
It's a bright new star!
Oh Come!
Be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way!
Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
Oh! You gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he!
Ali Ababwa Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee!
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Sunday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali!
Mighty is he!
Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

He's got seventy-five golden camels
(Don't they look lovely June?)
Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three
(Fabulous Harry i love the feathers)
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak
Weak at the knees
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!

He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys
(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee
(He's generous, so generous)
He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just bouncing with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for prince Ali!

LYRICS:
You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep

'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude
But I would just stand and stare

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems

'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance

A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
When I fall asleep

Leave my door open just a crack
(Please take me away from here)
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
(Please take me away from here)
Why do I tire of counting sheep
(Please take me away from here)
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell

But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
When I fall asleep

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
When I fall asleep

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay
Awake when I'm asleep
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

When I grow up
I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dark eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never liked a sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet and cry for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I wait for him to catch me

Waiting for you to embrace me

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

(Happy Christmas)
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you,' I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
(You gave it away)
This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore him apart
Ooh hoo, now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away

This year to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

What if I’m wrong, what if I’ve lied 
 What if I’ve dragged you here to my own dark night 
 And what if I know, what if I see 
 There is a crack run right down the front of me 

 What if they’re right, what if we’re wrong 
 What if I’ve lured you here with a siren song? 

 But if I be wrong, if I be right 
 Let me be here with you tonight 

 Ten thousand cars, ten thousand trains 
 There are ten thousand roads to run away 

 But I am not lost, I am not found 
 I am not Dylan’s wife, not Cohen’s hound 

 But if I be wrong, if I be right 
 Let me be here with you tonight 

 And what if I can’t, what if I can 
 What if I’m just an ordinary man 

 If there is a will, there is a way 
 I will escape for sure, I am David Blane 

 But if I be wrong, if I be right 
 Let me be here with you 
 If I be wrong, if I be right 
 Let me stay here in your arms tonight 
 And I have been wrong, I have been right 
 I have been both these things all in the same night 
 So if I be wrong, if I be right 
 Let me here, with you, tonight.

We can remember
Swimming in December
Heading for the city lights
In nineteen seventy five

We share in each other
Nearer than father
The scent of a lemon
Drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure
Love in the summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life

For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven
Got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we'd energized
Lie in the sand and visualize
Like it's seventy five again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave me, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?

My Favorite Things (Maria)
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
