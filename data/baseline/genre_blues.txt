TITLE: At Last Lyrics
LYRICS:
At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a song

Oh yeah yeah, at last
The skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up in clover
The night I looked at you

And I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I have never known

Oh yeah yeah, and you smile, you smile
Oh, and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

Je L'aime à Mourir
Paroles et musique : Francis Cabrel
(c) 1979 Éditions Marouani

1	Moi je n'étais rien et voilà qu'aujourd'hui,
	Je suis le gardien du sommeil de ses nuits. Je l'aime à mourir
	Vous pouvez détruire tout ce qui vous plaira
	Elle n'a qu'à ouvrir l'espace de ses bras
	Pour tout reconstruire. Pour tout reconstruire. Je l'aime à mourir

	Elle a gommé les chiffres des horloges du quartier
	Elle a fait de ma vie des cocottes en papier, des éclats de rire
	Elle a bâti des ponts entre nous et le ciel
	Et nous les traversons à chaque fois qu'elle
	Ne veut pas dormir. Ne veut pas dormir. Je l'aime à mourir

R	Elle a dû faire toutes les guerres pour être aussi forte aujourd'hui,
	Elle a dû faire toutes les guerres de la vie et l'amour aussi.

2	Elle vit de son mieux ses rêves d'opaline
	Elle danse au milieu des forêts qu'elle dessine. Je l'aime à mourir
	Elle porte des rubans qu'elle laisse s'envoler
	Elle me chante souvent que j'ai tort d'essayer
	De les retenir. De les retenir. Je l'aime à mourir

	Pour monter dans sa grotte cachée sous les toits
	Je dois clouer des notes à mes sabots de bois. Je l'aime à mourir
	Je dois juste m'asseoir, je ne dois plus parler,
	Je ne dois rien vouloir, je dois juste essayer
	De lui appartenir. De lui appartenir.

Refrain...

TITLE: Ain't No Love In The Heart Of The City Lyrics
LYRICS:
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love and it's sure 'nuff a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

When you were mine
Oh, I was feeling good
'Cause you lovlied up
This whole neighborhood

But now that you're gone
You know the sun don't shine
From the city hall to the county line
That's why I said

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love and it sure is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

Every place that I go
Oh, it seems so strange
Without you there
Things have changed

The nights are cold
There's a blanket of gloom
Another trick I saw
In my lonely room

I said, ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, ain't any pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

And now that you're gone
Oh, the sun don't shine
From the city hall to
The county line, I said

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love, it sure is a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around
'Cause you ain't around

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in this great, big, old town
Ain't no love and ain't it a pity
Ain't no love 'cause you ain't around

Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of this town

TITLE: Crazy Blues Lyrics
LYRICS:
I can't sleep at night
I can't eat a bite
'Cause the man I love
He don't treat me right

He makes me feel so blue
I don't know what to do
Sometime I sit and sigh
And then begin to cry
'Cause my best friend
Said his last goodbye

There's a change in the ocean
Change in the deep blue sea, my baby
I'll tell you folks, there ain't no change in me
My love for that man will always be

Now I can read his letters
I sure can't read his mind
I thought he's lovin' me
He's leavin' all the time
Now I see my poor love was blind

Now I got the crazy blues
Since my baby went away
I ain't got no time to lose
I must find him today

Now the doctor's gonna do all that he can
But what you're gonna need is an undertaker man
I ain't had nothin' but bad news
Now I got the crazy blues

A she worries me, so
If she'd leave us alone
A we would have a happy home
Sent from down below

Mother in law, mother in law

Satan should be her name
To me they're bout the same
Every time I open my mouth
She steps in, tries to put me out
How could she stoop so low

I come home with my pay
She asks me what I made
She thinks her advice is a contribution
But if she would leave that would be the solution
And don't come back no more

Mother in law
My mother in law, ah
Oh, yeah

I'm with you, I'm lonely too
What's that song
Can't be sung by two?

A broken home, a broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

You're not alone, every night
I stand in your place
Every tear on every face
Tastes the same

A broken dream, a broken heart
Isolated and afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

An open hand, an open heart
There's no need to be afraid
Open up this is a raid
I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

I wanna get it through to you
You're not alone

She's simply awesome
She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned 'cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

She is the queen

TITLE: In the Jailhouse Now Lyrics
LYRICS:
I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob
Who used to steal, gamble and rob
He thought he was the smartest guy in town

But I found out last Monday
That Bob got locked up Sunday
They've got him in the jailhouse way down town

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

He played a game called his Poker
He knock on Whist and Euchre
But shootin' dice was his greatest game

Now he's down town in jail
Nobody to go his bail
The judge done said that he refused the fine

He's in the jailhouse now, he's in the jailhouse now
I told him once or twice
To quit playin' cards and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

I went out last Tuesday
Met a girl named Susie
I told her I was the swellest man around

We started to spend my money
Then she started to call me honey
We took in every cabaret in town

We're in the jailhouse now, we're in the jailhouse now
I told the judge right to his face
We didn't like to see this place
We're in the jailhouse now

Pulls my man around by her apron strings
Wasn't for powder and his store-bought hair

Until that first hello, until that first smile
But if I had to do it all again, I wouldn't change a thing

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly, you're in love

Girl, you're everything a man could want and more
One thousand words are not enough to say what I feel inside
Holding hands as we walk aong the shore
Never felt like this before, now you're all I'm living for

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
And things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly, you're in love

Each day I pray
This love affair would last forever

Suddenly, life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
Ad things we never take notice of
You wake up, suddenly, you're in love

Things we never take notice of

They don't bother you, well they don't bother me
Engine too loud in this brand new Ferrari V
So we couldn't hear the haters anyway, pardon me
Girls say I'm one of the biggest hearbreakers arguably
Cupid shoot arrows but this girl make my heart bleed
I swear to God if I die she could make my heart beat
Beat, please resuscitate a G
Give me mouth-to-mouth or even give me south-to mouth
Damn 'cause you don't know what she do to me
She could kill my soul only thing left is a eulogy
She so hot and ain't another brother cool as me
To get her cold as me I think I gotta buy her jewelry
What she do to me

You say its poppin' if its rockin' listen we there

Come on be clear
