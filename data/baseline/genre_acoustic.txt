TITLE: This Sweet Love Lyrics
LYRICS:
Be the greatest man in history
The greatest man that you can be
Just be

Walk, walk out on the beach with me
Walk out in the sea with me
Just be

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love

Nights, cold nights wrapped in ecstasy
Those times still perplexing be
They just be

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love

All of the time you show me your love
Sweet love
And oh, how you know
This sweet love, this sweet love
This sweet love, this sweet love

A Good Day
Dream
I was a little girl alone in my little world who dreamed of a little home for me.
I played pretend between the trees, and fed my houseguests bark and leaves, and laughed in my pretty bed of green.

I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest swing.
I had a dream.

Long walks in the dark through woods grown behind the park, I asked God who I'm supposed to be.
The stars smiled down on me, God answered in silent reverie. I said a prayer and fell asleep.

I had a dream
That I could fly from the highest tree.
I had a dream.

Now I'm old and feeling grey. I don't know what's left to say about this life I'm willing to leave.
I lived it full and I lived it well, there's many tales I've lived to tell. I'm ready now, I'm ready now, I'm ready now to fly from the highest wing.

I had a dream

TITLE: Perhaps Love Lyrics
LYRICS:
Perhaps love is like a resting place
A shelter from the storm
It exists to give you comfort
It is there to keep you warm
And in these time of trouble
When you are most alone
The memory of love will bring you home

Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer
It wants you to show you more
and even when you lose yourself
And don’t know what to do
The memory of love will see you through

Oh, love to some is like cloud
To some as strong as steel
For some a way of living
For some a way of feel
And some say love holding on
And some say letting go
And some love is ev’rything
And some say that they don’t know

Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflict full of pain
Like a fire when it’s cold outside
Or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever
And all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you

And some say love is holding on
And some say letting go
And some say love is eve’rything
And some say that they don’t know

Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflict full of pain
Like a fire when it’s cold outside
Or thunder when it rains
If I should live forever
And all my dreams come true
My memories of love will be of you

TITLE: Le Vent Nous Portera Lyrics
LYRICS:
Je n'ai pas peur de la route
Faudrait voir, faut qu'on y goûte
Des méandres au creux des reins
Et tout ira bien là
Le vent nous portera

Ton message à la Grande Ourse
Et la trajectoire de la course
Un instantané de velours
Même s'il ne sert à rien va
Le vent l'emportera
Tout disparaîtra mais
Le vent nous portera

La caresse et la mitraille
Et cette plaie qui nous tiraille
Le palais des autres jours
D'hier et demain
Le vent les portera

Génetique en bandouillère
Des chromosomes dans l'atmosphère
Des taxis pour les galaxies
Et mon tapis volant dis ?
Le vent l'emportera
Tout disparaîtra mais
Le vent nous portera

Ce parfum de nos années mortes
Ce qui peut frapper à ta porte
Infinité de destins
On en pose un et qu'est-ce qu'on en retient?
Le vent l'emportera

Pendant que la marée monte
Et que chacun refait ses comptes
J'emmène au creux de mon ombre
Des poussières de toi
Le vent les portera
Tout disparaîtra mais
Le vent nous portera

TITLE: Refuge (Acoustic) Lyrics
LYRICS:
Fear lives, in these bones
I am helpless on, I'm so helpless on 
my own

We started giving in, our walls our wearing thin
Our light is growing dim, we are
So far from where we want to be
There's nothing for me here
So grab your coat, let's leave this place my dear

The colours of my soul are seeking refuge
In somebody elses arms
Now I must try, to win them back somehow
I've fallen hard and fallen short
But love is not a winners game at all

Now I must try to forget about it now

Fear lives, in these bones
I am, helpless on 
I'm so helpless on my own

And will time get the better of me,
we'll have to wait and see,
for now I'll keep floating down this dark abyss, of lonliness

But before I leave, just one last kiss now

The colours of my soul are seeking refuge
In somebody elses arms,
Now i must try to win them back somehow

I've fallen hard, and fallen short 
but love is not a winners game at all
now I must try to forget about it now

The colours of my soul are seeking refuge 
in somebody elses arms
now i must try to win them back somehow

TITLE: I Don't Believe In Love Lyrics
LYRICS:
I don't believe in, I don't believe in love*
Say what you want to, say want to me, 
Why does it happen? Why does it happen only to me,

It starts with a kiss but ends with a bitch,
I don't know why I put myself in all of this,
I just want to say goodbye,
When you came into, when you came into my Life,
I wanted you to be, I wanted you to be my wife,
I couldn't life with, I couldn't live without you,

You said that you cared, and I really knew that you'd be the one,
I gave you my heart, but look what you did,
Oh what have I done, 

It starts with a kiss, but ends with a bitch,
I don't know why I put myself through all of this,
I just want to say goodbye,
To love

I don't believe in, I don't believe in,
I don't believe in, I don't believe in,

I don't believe in, I don't believe in,
I don't believe in, I don't believe in,

I don't believe in, I don't believe in,
I don't believe in, I don't believe in,

I don't believe in, I don't believe in,
I don't believe in, I don't believe in,

I never knew how long this would take. I think I’ll lie down. 
You never wanted to be with me, Oh I cry. 

You were always the quiet one. Please speak up for us. 
I want to hear what you have to say. It's that time of year. 

Why do we even pretend? I don’t want to be your friend, anymore. 
Ever since that single day, you kicked me out the front door and I walked away. 

You say that you want me to go. 
And I wonder what you’ve become. 
You say that you want me to go.
And I wonder what you’ve become.

Love Songs On The Radio
She looks just like an angel
When she walks across the room
She shines tonight
Her golden light
Is everything I need

Lovers all around her
She wears them like her jewels
My friend says she's all he needs
To feel alive

Love songs on the radio
His sweetheart lies in bed
She's dreaming of the things he said
She's hoping that he's well

Love, it's a special day*
We should celebrate and appreciate
That you and me found something pretty neat
And I know some say this day is arbitrary

But it's a good excuse
Put our love to use
Baby, I know what to do
Baby, I will love you
I'll love you
I'll love you

Love, I don't need those things
I don't need no ring, I don't need anything
But you with me, 'cause in your company
I feel happy, oh so happy, and complete

And it's a good excuse
Put our love to use
Baby, I know what to do
Baby, I will love you
I'll love you
I'll love you

So won't you be my honeybee
Giving me kisses all the time
Be mine, be my valentine

So won't you be my honeybee
Giving sweet kisses all the time
Be mine, be my valentine
Be my valentine

TITLE: Untitled (Into the Flame) Lyrics
LYRICS:
So I threw your letter into the flame
And watched the fire regain
And these words have done nothing for you
As I did not read them through
Now turned to ash in the flue

And colors are dull
As the feeling of the cold
And memories fall
As the fire is getting old
Oh and I once more am now

Don’t you fret I’ll find my way
Carefully walking from the devil’s plane
And I know why you did not follow me
Pride swallowed me then led me astray

And now the dark in me has now seen the day
Oh my chill has now lost its way
And these hands that once had helped me to pray
They are limp in all their dismay
Oh they fall in their disarray

And colors are dull
As the feeling of the cold
And memories fall
As the fire is getting old
Oh and I once more am now

Oh don’t you fret I’ll find my way
Carefully walking from the devil’s plane
And I know why you did not follow me
Pride swallowed me then led me astray

May ibang sumusuyo
Sa puso kong para sayo
Aaminin ko may ibang tibok
Ang puso kong lito

Sana ay malaman mo
Ikaw pa rin ang hanap ko
Ngunit isang ngiti nya lang
Nahuhulog ang puso kong lito

CHORUS:

Pero mahal na mahal kita
At mahal na mahal ko siya
Hindi ko alam ano ang gagawin
Bakit ang puso kong ito
Hirap at litong-lito
Sana naman sana naman sana naman
Maramdaman mo

Alam mong mahal kita
Sana maniwala ka
Kahit may ibang hinahanap
Ang puso kong lito

Kung matuturuan lang
Angpuso kong lito
'Di na sana nag ka ganito
Umiibig sa isang katulad niya

TITLE: Sky To Ground Lyrics
LYRICS:
I've seen babies begging, scratching round for food to eat
I've seen a big old tree still standing tall, two thousand years healthy
I've seen the oldest woman shaking her head at what went wrong
I drank water from a stream so fresh you could't see the water at all. 
at all.

I've seen streets so dirty, there is hardly a place to walk and
I've fallen asleep to our bush birds, singing the prettiest song
I've seen all of the pain and all the murder on tv and 
I've stood free on soild waves, mother earths greatest treats

Oh peace on earth that i know
Sending us out to war my friend 
this place my home from sky to ground
see the universe conneted from the inside  

I've seen people screaming at the car that cut them off
and ive felt the cleanest mountian air cleaning out my nose
I've seen fast food chains nearly every place that i go 
Ive had a belly full of the freshest fish speared with a single throw

and i sing 
Oh peace on earth that i know
Sending us out to war my friend 
this place my home from sky to ground
see the universe conneted from the inside  

there's been changes in weather like never before
changing the winter and summer and spring
many many people still listening to the earth and her song
so is sing it strong

Oh peace on earth that i know
Sending us out to war my friend 
this place my home from sky to ground
see the universe conneted from the inside 

in theses times of trouble in these times of war
in theses times when our planet is it getting to warm
it makes me simle to take a look around
of this earth and this earth we can be so proud

TITLE: Fools, Don't Listen To A Word I Say Lyrics
LYRICS:
Salutary tongues that speak in turn. Waiting for their chance to make us yearn.
The sounds and emotions spreading thin, we’ll sink the float that would not let us win.
A solitary cheer that does not work. We cottoned on to all their taints and quirks.
And fled to the mountains on a whim, watching all the mess behind us sink.
And that’s no way to listen to our sonnet.
They’re buzzing like a bee inside my bonnet.
But the fools never listen to what I say.
They’ve copied all their lines into a prayer.

Fools, don’t listen to a word I say. Just look the other way.
I’m not saying I’ve got much to say. Just look the other way.

I had a friend that went home to god
At least thats what im hoping
But thats how life goes 
Like it or not
You couldnt know how I felt 
When you went away
And now I know my life 
Will never be the same
(be the same x2)
It will never be the same without you
i dont want
This to be the end
I dont want
To have to say goodbye
I dont want 
This to be over
but this is not over
Ill see you someday down
At the end of lifes road youll be there
With your arms wide open
But until then I guess this is goodbye
You were the one that kept me in line
When I got to crazy
Now that youre gone
Im doing just fine
But it seems lately that I
Cry myself to sleep
Cuz I know that you
Will never be with me
I dont want
This to be the end
I dont want
To have to say goodbye
I dont want 
This to be over
but this is not over
Ill see you someday down

TITLE: Cupid Shoot Me Lyrics
LYRICS:
I'm sure you'd agree,
It ain't you it's me,
No matter how I try I just can't feel the way inside he wants me to,
So what should I do?
Mistakes we all make,
No matter how it aches I must do whatever it takes to love him

I don't know how to love him,
I don't know how to care for him,
Cupid shoot me with your bow,
So I know, how to love him so,
Oh Oh Oh

Got to open my heart,
And forget the past,
And see how much he loves me when he looks into my eyes and hugs me,
Can't go my whole life,
Resenting my man, 
Cause he's apologised and he's trying the best he can but I just...

I don't know how to love him,
I don't know how to care for him,
Cupid shoot me with your bow,
So I know, how to love him so,
Oh Oh Oh

Cupid shoot me,
Shoot me with your bow,
So I know...
Cupid shoot me,
Shoot me with your bow,
So I know....

I don't know how to love him,
I don't know how to care for him,
Cupid shoot me with your bow,
So I know, how to love him so,
Oh Oh Oh

I don't know how to love him,
I don't know how to care for him,
Cupid shoot me with your bow,
So I know, how to love him so,
