LYRICS:
I’m holding on to the hope that one day this could be made right.
I’ve been shipwrecked, and left for dead, and I have seen the darkest sights.
Everyone I’ve loved seems like a stranger in the night
But Oh my heart still burns, tells me to return, and search the fading light.

I’m sailing home to you I wont be long
By the light of moon I will press on
Until, I find, my love

Trouble has beset my ways, and wicked winds have blown
Sirens call my name, they say they’ll ease my pain, then break me on the stones
But true love is the burden that will carry me back home
Carry me with the, memories of the, beauty I have known

I’m sailing home to you I wont be long
By the light of moon I will press on

So tie me to the mast of this old ship and point me home
Before I lose the one I love, before my chance is gone
I want to hold, her in, my arms

LYRICS:
It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat

Eet, eet, eet
Eet, eet, eet

You spend half of your life trying to fall behind
You're using your headphones to drown out your mind
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to move your feet

Eet, eet, eet
Eet, eet, eet

Someone's deciding whether or not to steal
He opens a window just to feel the chill
He hears that outside a small boy just started to cry
'Cause it's his turn, but his brother won't let him try

It's like forgetting the words to your favorite song
You can't believe it, you were always singing along
It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to move your feet

It was so easy and the words so sweet
You can't remember, you try to feel the beat

LYRICS:
Use the truth as a weapon
To beat up all your friends
Every chink in the armor
An excuse to cause offense

And the boys from the hallway
Calling out your name
And true love
Will find them in the end

You were restless
I was somewhere less secure
So I went running to the road

And so now there's
A long list of places I was
I quit my rambling and came home

'Cause maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms

Use your saints and your mantra
And your things to keep you calm
If you stay with that asshole
He's gonna do you harm

There's a voice singing loudly
On the radio just for you
And good fortune
Will find him in the end

Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms

Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms
Maybe I was born
To hold you in these arms

LYRICS:
Farther along we’ll know all about it
Farther along we’ll understand why
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
We’ll understand this, all by and by

Tempted and tried, I wondered why
The good man died, the bad man thrives
And Jesus cries because he loves em’ both
We’re all cast-aways in need of ropes
Hangin’ on by the last threads of our hope
In a house of mirrors full of smoke
Confusing illusions I’ve seen

Where did I go wrong, I sang along
To every chorus of the song
That the devil wrote like a piper at the gates
Leading mice and men down to their fates
But some will courageously escape
The seductive voice with a heart of faith
While walkin’ that line back home

So much more to life than we’ve been told
It’s full of beauty that will unfold
And shine like you struck gold my wayward son
That deadweight burden weighs a ton
Go down into the river and let it run
And wash away all the things you’ve done
Forgiveness alright

Chorus

Still I get hard pressed on every side
Between the rock and a compromise
Like the truth and pack of lies fightin’ for my soul
And I’ve got no place left go
Cause I got changed by what I’ve been shown
More glory than the world has known
Keeps me ramblin’ on

Skipping like a calf loosed from its stall
I’m free to love once and for all
And even when I fall I’ll get back up
For the joy that overflows my cup
Heaven filled me with more than enough
Broke down my levee and my bluff
Let the flood wash me

And one day when the sky rolls back on us
Some rejoice and the others fuss
Cause every knee must bow and tongue confess
That the son of God is forever blessed
His is the kingdom, we’re the guests
So put your voice up to the test
Sing Lord, come soon

Chorus

ARTIST: Josh Garrels
LYRICS:
Stand on the shores of a site unseen
The substance of this dwells in me
Cause my natural eyes only go skin deep
But the eye’s of my heart anchor the sea
Plumbing the depths to the place in between
The tangible world and the land of a dreams
Because everything ain’t quite it seems
There’s more beneath the appearance of things
A beggar could be king within the shadows,
Of a wing

And wisdom will honor everyone who will learn
To listen, to love, and to pray and discern
And to do the right thing even when it burns
And to live in the light through treacherous turns
A man is weak, but the spirit yearns
To keep on course from the bow to the stearn
And throw overboard every selfish concern
That tries to work for what can’t be earned
Sometimes the only way to return is to go,
Where the winds will take you

And to let go, of all, you cannot hold onto
For the hope, beyond,the blue

Yellow and gold as the new day dawns
Like a virgin unveiled who waited so long
To dance and rejoice and sing her song
And rest in the arms of a love so strong
No one comes unless they’re drawn
By the voice of desire that leads em’ along
To the redemption of what went wrong
By the blood that coveres the innocent one
No more separation
Between us.

So lift your voice just one more time
If there’s any hope may it be a sign
That everything was made to shine
Despite what you can see
So take this bread and drink this wine
And hide your spirit within the vine
Where all things will work by a good design
For those who will believe

And let go, of all, we cannot hold onto
For the hope, beyond, the blue

Said I let go, of all, I could not hold onto
For the hope, I have, in you

LYRICS:
My life flows on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation.
I hear the real, though far off hymn
That hails the new creation

No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
It sounds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing?

What though the tempest round me roars
I know the truth it liveth
What though the darkness round me close
Songs in the night it giveth

No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that rock I'm clinging.
Since love is lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?

When tyrants tremble, sick with fear,
And hear their death-knell ringing,
When friends rejoice both far and near,
How can I keep from singing?

In prison cell and dungeon vile
Our thoughts to them are winging.
When friends by shame are undefiled,
How can I keep from singing?

I wanna sit you down and talk
I wanna pull back the veils
And find out what it is I've done wrong
I wanna tear these curtains down
I want you to meet me somewhere
Tonight in this old tourist town
And we'll go

Low rising
'Cause we've gotta come up
We've gotta come up
Low rising
'Cause I fear we've had enough
Low rising
'Cause there's no further for us to fall
Low rising
Oh, for the love of you

I wanna take you to the rock
I wanna jump right in
And see what that big ocean's got
I wanna turn this thing around
I wanna drink with you
All night, till we both fall down
Till we go

'Cause we've gotta come up
We've gotta come up
Low rising
'Cause there's no further for us to fall

This is the last song that I write while still in love with you
This is the last song that I write while you're even on my mind
'Cos it's time to leave those feelings behind

Oh, 'cos blue skies are coming
But I know that it's hard

I don't think that it's the end
But I know we can't keep going

LYRICS:
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere

Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we’ll make something
But me myself I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won’t have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
finally see what it means to be living

See my old man’s got a problem
He live with the bottle that’s the way it is
He says his body’s too old for working
his body’s too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody’s got to take care of him
So I quit school and that’s what I did

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

so I remember when we were driving,driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I,I had a feeling that I belonged
And I,I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
We go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain’t got a job
And I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You’ll find work and I’ll get promoted
We’ll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

So I remember when we were driving,driving in your car
speed so fast It felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I,I had a feeling that I belonged
And I,I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking till late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I’d always hoped for better
But maybe together you and me'd find it
If you got no plans and ain’t going nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I,I had a feeling that I belonged
And I,I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so you can fly away
You gotta make a decision
You leave tonight or live and die this way

LYRICS:
I sense a runner in the garden
Although my judgements known to fail
Once built a steamboat in a meadow
Cos I'd forgotten how to sail

I know the runner's going to tell you
There ain't no cowboy in my hair
So now he's buried by the daisies
So I could stay the tallest man in your eyes, babe

I sense a spy up in the chimney
From all the evidence I've burned
I guess he'll read it in the smoke now
And soon to ashes I'll return

I know the spy is going to tell you
It's not my flag up in the pole
So now he's buried by the lilies
So I could stay forever more in your eyes, babe

I sense a leak inside my phone now
From all the lies that I have told
I know he has your private number
And soon he'll make that vicious call

I know the leak is going to tell you
There ain't no puppy in your leash
So now he'll fertilize the roses
So I could stay the king you see
In your eyes, babe (x2)

So now we're dancing through the garden
And what a garden I have made
And now that death will grow my jasmine
I find it soothing I'm afraid

Now there is no need for suspicion
There ain't no fraud kissing your hand
I won't be lying when I tell you
That I'm a gardner I'm a man
In your eyes babe (x3)

LYRICS:
Two little boys had two little toys
Each had a wooden horse
Gaily they played each summers day
Warriors both of cause

One little chap then had a mishap
Broke off his horses head
Wept for his toy, then cried with joy
As his young playmate said

Did you think I would leave you crying?
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here, Jack and don't be crying
I can go just as fast with two

When we grow up we'll both be soldiers
And our horses will not be toys
And I wonder if we'll remember when we were
Two little boys

Long years past, war came so fast
Bravely they marched away
Cannon roared loud and in the mad crowd
Wounded and dieing lie, up goes a shout

A horse dashes out
Out from the ranks so blue
Gallops away to where Joe lay
Then came a voice he know

Did you think I would leave you dying?
When there's room on my horse for two
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying
I can go just as fast with two

Did you say Joe, I'm all a tremble?
Perhaps it's the battles noise
But I thinks it's that I remember
When we were two little boys

Do you think I would leave you dying?
There's room on my horse for two
Climb up here, Joe we'll soon be flying
Back to the ranks so blue

Can you feel Joe, I'm all a tremble?
Perhaps it's the battles noise
But I think it's that I remember
When we were two little boys

LYRICS:
Once there were green fields, kissed by the sun
Once there were valleys where rivers used to run
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above
Once they were part of an everlasting love
We were the lovers who strolled through green fields

Green fields are gone now, parched by the sun
Gone from the valleys, where rivers used to run
Gone with the cold wind, that swept into my heart
Gone with the lovers, who let their dreams depart
Where are the green fields that we used to roam ?

I'll never know what made you run away
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day
I only know there's nothing here for me
Nothing in this wide world left for me to see

But I'll keep on waiting until you return
I'll keep on waiting until the day you learn
You can't be happy while your heart's on the roam
You can't be happy until you bring it home
Home to the green fields and me once again

LYRICS:
Dominique, nique, nique, over the land he plods
And sings a little song
Never asking for reward
He just talks about the Lord
He just talks about the Lord

At a time when Johnny Lackland
Over England was the King
Dominique was in the backland
Fighting sin like anything

Now a heretic, one day
Among the thorns forced him to crawl
Dominique with just one prayer
Made him hear the good Lord's call

Without horse or fancy wagon
He crossed Europe up and down
Poverty was his companion
As he walked from town to town

To bring back the straying liars
And the lost sheep to the fold
He brought forth the Preaching Friars
Heaven's soldier's, brave and bold

One day, in the budding Order
There was nothing left to eat
Suddenly two angels walked in
With a loaf of bread and meat

Dominique once, in his slumber
Saw the Virgin's coat unfurled
Over Frairs without number
Preaching all around the world

Grant us now, oh Dominique
The grace of love and simple mirth
That we all may help to quicken
Godly life and truth on earth

Dominique, nique, nique s'en allait tout simplement
Routier pauvre et chantant
En tous chemins, en tous lieux, il ne parle que du bon Dieu

Il ne parle que du bon Dieu
A l'e poque ou Jean-sans-Terre de' Angleterre etait Roi
Dominique, notre Pere, combattit les Albigeois
Repeat first 4 lines: Chorus

Ni chameau, ni diligence il parcout l'Europe a pied
Scandinavie ou Provence dans la sainte pauvrete

Certain jour un hérétique par des ronces le conduit,
Mais notre père Dominique par sa joie le convertit.

Enflamma de toute ecole filles et garcons pleins d'ardeur
Et pour semer la Parole inventa les Freres-Precheurs

That David played and it pleased the Lord

The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you

She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say, I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?

There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you

And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

LYRICS:
It was back in nineteen forty-two,
I was a member of a good platoon.
We were on maneuvers in-a Loozianna,
One night by the light of the moon.
The captain told us to ford a river,
That's how it all begun.
We were -- knee deep in the Big Muddy,
But the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, "Sir, are you sure,
This is the best way back to the base?"
"Sergeant, go on! I forded this river
'Bout a mile above this place.
It'll be a little soggy but just keep slogging.
We'll soon be on dry ground."
We were -- waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

The Sergeant said, "Sir, with all this equipment
No man will be able to swim."
"Sergeant, don't be a Nervous Nellie,"
The Captain said to him.
"All we need is a little determination;
Men, follow me, I'll lead on."
We were -- neck deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool said to push on.

All at once, the moon clouded over,
We heard a gurgling cry.
A few seconds later, the captain's helmet
Was all that floated by.
The Sergeant said, "Turn around men!
I'm in charge from now on."
And we just made it out of the Big Muddy
With the captain dead and gone.

We stripped and dived and found his body
Stuck in the old quicksand.
I guess he didn't know that the water was deeper
Than the place he'd once before been.
Another stream had joined the Big Muddy
'Bout a half mile from where we'd gone.
We were lucky to escape from the Big Muddy
When the big fool said to push on.

Well, I'm not going to point any moral;
I'll leave that for yourself
Maybe you're still walking, you're still talking
You'd like to keep your health.
But every time I read the papers
That old feeling comes on;
We're -- waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.

Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep in the Big Muddy
And the big fool says to push on.
Waist deep! Neck deep! Soon even a
Tall man'll be over his head, we're
Waist deep in the Big Muddy!
And the big fool says to push on!

LYRICS:
Early on one Christmas Day a Joey Kangaroo
Was far from home and lost in a great big zoo
Mummy, where's my mummy? They've taken her away
We'll help you find your mummy, son, hop up on the sleigh

Up beside the bag of toys little Joey hopped
But they hadn't gone far when Santa stopped
Unharnessed all the reindeer and Joey wondered why
Then he heard a far off booming in the sky

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Pretty soon old Santa began to feel the heat
Took his fur lined boots off to cool his feet
Into one popped Joey, feeling quite okay
While those old man kangaroos kept pulling on the sleigh

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Joey said to Santa, "Santa, what about the toys?
Aren't you giving some to these girls and boys?"
They've got all their presents, son, we were here last night
This trip is an extra trip, Joey's special flight

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Soon the sleigh was flashing past right over Marble Bar
"Slow down there", cried Santa, "It can't be far"
Come up on my lap here, son, and have a look around
There she is, that's mummy, bounding up and down

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Well, that's the bestest Christmas treat that Joey ever had
Curled up in mother's pouch feeling snug and glad
The last they saw was Santa heading northwards from the sun
The only year the boomers worked a double run

Six white boomers, snow white boomers
Racing Santa Claus through the blazing sun
Six white boomers, snow white boomers
On his Australian run

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby, I got your number
And I know that you got mine
You know that I called you
I called too many times

You can call me, baby
You can call me anytime
You got to call me

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life
I don't want no one to squeeze me
They might take away my life

I just want someone to hold me
And rock me through the night

This youthful heart can love you, yes
And give you what you need
I said, â€½This youthful heart can love you
And give you what you needâ€

But I'm too old to go chasing you around
Wasting my precious energy

Give me one reason to stay here
And I'll turn right back around
Give me one reason to stay here
I'll turn right back around

Said, I don't wanna leave you lonely
You got to make me change my mind

Baby just give me one reason
Give me just one reason why
Baby just give me one reason
Give me just one reason why I should stay

Said, I told you that I loved you
And there ain't no more to say
