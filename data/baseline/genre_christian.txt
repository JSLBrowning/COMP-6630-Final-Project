TITLE: Even If Lyrics
LYRICS:
They say sometimes you win some
Sometimes you lose some
And right now, right now I'm losing bad
I've stood on this stage night after night
Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't

It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Good thing
A little faith is all I have right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

You've been faithful, You've been good
All of my days
Jesus, I will cling to You
Come what may
â€˜Cause I know You're able
I know You can

I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
I know the sorrow, and I know the hurt
Would all go away if You'd just say the word
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

It is well with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul

[Verse 1]
I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, and I pray for you

[Verse 2]
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there

[Chorus]
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does

TITLE: Oh My Soul Lyrics
LYRICS:
Oh, my soul
Oh, how you worry
Oh, how you're weary from fearing
You lost control
This was the one thing
You didn't see coming
And no one would blame you though
If you cried in private
If you tried to hide it away
So no one knows
No one will see
If you stop believing

Oh, my soul
You are not alone
There's a place where fear
Has to face the God you know
One more day
He will make a way
Let Him show you how
You can lay this down
'cause you're not alone

Here and now
You can be honest
I won't try to promise
That someday it all works out
'cause this is the valley
And even now
He is breathing on
Your dry bones
And there will be dancing
There will be beauty where beauty was
Ash and stone
This much I know

I'm not strong enough
I can't take anymore
You can lay it down
You can lay it down
And my shipwrecked faith
Will never get me to shore
You can lay it down
You can lay it down
Can he find me here?
Can he keep me from going under?

Oh, my soul
You are not alone

TITLE: I Have This Hope Lyrics
LYRICS:
As I walk this great unknown
Questions come and questions go
Was there purpose for the pain?
Did I cry these tears in vain?

I don't want to live in fear
I want to trust that You are near
Trust Your grace can be seen
In both triumph and tragedy

I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

But sometimes my faith feels thin
Like the night will never end
Will You catch every tear
Or will You just leave me here?

But I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go
[x2]

So, whatever happens I will not be afraid
Cause You are closer than this breath that I take
You calm the storm when I hear You call my name
I still believe that one day I'll see Your face

And I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me
I have this hope
In the depth of my soul
In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

In the flood or the fire
You're with me and You won't let go

You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise my soul will rest in your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
You've never failed and you won't start now

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in your embrace
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

I will call upon Your Name
Keep my eyes above the waves
My soul will rest in Your embrace
I am Yours and You are mine

Not scared to say it, I used to be the one
Preaching it to you, that you could overcome
I still believe it, but it ain't easy
'Cause that world I painted, where things just all work out
It started changing and I started having doubts
And it got me so down

But I picked myself back up
And I started telling me
No, my God's not done
Making me a masterpiece
He's still working on me

He started something good and I'm gonna believe it
He started something good and He's gonna complete it
So I'll celebrate the truth
His work in me ain't through
I'm just unfinished
I'm just unfinished
So I'll celebrate the truth
His work in me ain't through
I'm just unfinished

I know His history and the kind of God He is
He might make it a mystery
But He's proving I can trust in Him
And yeah, I believe it

So I can pick myself back up
And keep on telling me
No, my God's not done
Making me a masterpiece
No, my God's not done

He started something good and I'm gonna believe it
He started something good and He's gonna complete it

LYRICS:
Produced By Pluss & Mike WiLL Made-It


[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Yah, yah, yah
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Swear the sun shinin' on me in my huddle
No matter the trouble surroundin' us
They don't see that it's a lot of us
Everybody move anonymous
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I was doin' all kinda bad
Where the choir at? Tell 'em I need a verse
Hit the pew and tell God He's first
Hit the studio to body a verse
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
I've been punchin' in the clock
Tryna keep the kitchen stocked
Man it's a blessin' 'cause we ain't ever had a lot
But all we need is all we got

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

[Post-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
I put my mama in the crib, said, "Stop stressin'"
I put my girl in a brand new diamond necklace
She said she need more of my love and affection
'Cause lately I've been workin' harder than ever
She said, "Baby, you a boss, baby, clear your schedule
Dolla you a boss, let's do somethin' special
Take me on a PJ, we should go to Mexico
I've been down for you, boy since when the money was low"
Anything for my bae 'cause she a blessing
If you woke up this morning it's a blessing

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

[Post-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I took so many losses
Coulda lost it
Left 'em leakin' like a faucet
Almost cost me
Everything that I got, all of my fam
Part of the plan
I was eatin' fried bologna out of the pan
Y'all don't understand
I was tryna get it
I'm in that studio tryna keep it pushin'
Patty pies, boy I kept 'em cookin'
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Blessings fallin' in line, guess I need a taper
And every loss is a lesson
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
I've been down before the come up, I ain't stressin'
Baby I'm too busy countin' all these blessings, blessings

[Post-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Blessings
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up
Count it up, count it up, count it up

LYRICS:
In the eye of the storm, You remain in control
And in the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm
When the solid ground is falling out from underneath my feet
Between the black skies, and my red eyes, I can barely see
When I realize I've been sold out by my friends and my family
I can feel the rain reminding me
In the eye of the storm, You remain in control
In the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm
Mmm, when my hopes and dreams are far from me, and I'm runnin' out of faith
I see the future I picture slowly fade away
And when the tears of pain and heartache are falling down my face
I find my peace in Jesus' name
In the eye of the storm (yeah, yeah), You remain in control (yes you do, Lord)
In the middle of the war, You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor, when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me (Your love surronds me) in the eye of the storm (in the eye of the storm)
...
When the test comes in and the doctor says I've only got a few months left
It's like a bitter pill I'm swallowing; I can barely take a breath
And when addiction steals my baby girl, and there's nothing I can do
My only hope is to trust You
I trust You, Lord
In the eye of the storm (yeah, yeah), You remain in control
In the middle of the war (middle of the war), You guard my soul (yeah!)
You alone are the anchor (ooh), when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me (yeah!)
In the eye of the storm, You remain in control (yes you do, Lord)
In the middle of the war (in the middle of the war), You guard my soul
You alone are the anchor (ooh), when my sails are torn
Your love surrounds me in the eye of the storm, oooh
Oh, in the eye of, oh, in the eye of the storm
I know You're watching me, yea, ay
When the storm is raging (when the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and my hope is gone, Lord)
When my flesh is failing, You're still holding on, oh whoa
When the storm is raging (the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and all my hope is gone)
When my flesh is failing (my flesh is failing), You're still holding on, oooh
When the storm is raging (when the storm is raging)
And my hope is gone (and my hope is gone)
Even when my flesh is failing (flesh is failing), You're still holding on, holding on
The Lord is my Shepherd
I have all that I need
He lets me rest in green meadows
He leads me beside peaceful streams
He renews my strength
He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to His Name
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid
For You are close beside me

Can't shake them

Do I measure up
Feels like a war I can't win

But I wasn't given the spirit of fear
I was given the power of love
Everything I've been fighting against
I'm gonna lift it up

I wanna be fearless
No holding back
No backing down
Fearless
Because I believe You're with me now
Bring on the unknown
Lead me and I'll go
Come set me free
God, I want to be
Fearless (I want to be)
Fearless (I want to be)

These mountains
These giants 
Will fall at a single word
In Your name
In Your strength
I'm more than a conqueror

I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
I'll call on Your name
I'll walk out in faith
