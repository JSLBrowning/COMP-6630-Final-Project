TITLE: Because of You Lyrics
LYRICS:
If ever you wondered
If you touched my soul, yes you do
Since I met you I'm not the same
You bring life to everything I do

Just the way you say hello
With one touch I can't let go
Never thought I'd fall in love
With you, yeah yeah

Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you

Sometimes I get lonely
And all I gotta do is think of you
You captured something inside of me
You make all of my dreams come true

It's not enough that you love me for me, yeah
You reached inside and touched me eternally
I love you best explains how I feel
For you, yeah-e-yeah

Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you

The magic in your eyes, true love I can't deny
When you hold me I just lose control
I want you to know that I'm never letting go
You mean so much to me I want the world to see
It's because of you

Because of you, my life has changed
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you

My life has changed
Thank you for the love and the joy you bring
Because of you, I feel no shame
I'll tell the world it's because of you
Because of you

TITLE: Kasih Tak Sampai Lyrics
LYRICS:
Indah..
Terasa indah..
Bila kita terbuai dalam alunan cinta..
Sedapat mungkin terciptakan rasa..
Keinginan saling memiliki

Namun bila,
Itu semua dapat terwujud
Dalam satu ikatan cinta
Tak semudah seperti yang pernah terbayang..
Menyatukan perasaan....

Chorus:
Tetaplah menjadi bintang dilangit
Agar cinta kita akan abadi
Biarlah sinarmu tetap menyinari alam ini,
Agar menjadi saksi cinta kita
Berdua...
Berdua..

Sudah..
Lambat sudah...
Kini semua harus berakhir
Mungkin inilah jalan yang terbaik
Dan kita mesti relakan kenyataan ini

Chorus

Music

Menjadi saksi kita berdua....

TITLE: Tu Scendi Dalle Stelle Lyrics
LYRICS:
Tu scendi dalle stelle, o Re del cielo,
e vieni in una grotta al freddo e al gelo. (2 v.)
O Bambino mio divino,
io ti vedo qui a tremar;
o Dio beato !
Ah, quanto ti costò l'avermi amato ! (2 v.)

A te, che sei del mondo il Creatore,
mancano panni e fuoco, o mio Signore. (2 v.)
Caro eletto pargoletto,
quanto questa povertà
più m'innamora,
giacché ti fece amor povero ancora. (2 v.)

Tu lasci il bel gioir del divin seno,
per giunger a penar su questo fieno. (2 v.)
Dolce amore del mio core,
dove amore ti trasportò ?
O Gesù mio,
per ché tanto patir ? per amor mio ! (2 v.)

Ma se fu tuo voler il tuo patire,
perché vuoi pianger poi, perché vagire ? (2 v.)
mio Gesù, t'intendo sì !
Ah, mio Signore !
Tu piangi non per duol, ma per amore. (2 v.)

Tu piangi per vederti da me ingrato
dopo sì grande amor, sì poco amato!
O diletto - del mio petto,
Se già un tempo fu così, or te sol bramo
Caro non pianger più, ch'io t'amo e t'amo (2 v.)

Tu dormi, Ninno mio, ma intanto il core
non dorme, no ma veglia a tutte l'ore
Deh, mio bello e puro Agnello
a che pensi? dimmi tu. O amore immenso,
un dì morir per te, rispondi, io penso. (2 v.)

Dunque a morire per me, tu pensi, o Dio
ed altro, fuor di te, amar poss'io?
O Maria. speranza mia,
se poc'amo il tuo Gesù, non ti sdegnare
amalo tu per me, s'io non so amare! (2 v)

TITLE: Beautiful World Lyrics
LYRICS:
Strawberry lips shining in the summer sun
Canary tips glowing there for everyone
You fell asleep under the cherry tree

La, la, la, la, la, la
It's a beautiful world and we're all here

Your winter skin warming in the summer sun
We know within you will stay forever young
You fell asleep under the starlit sea
It's time to wake up

The moon is high above you
We're all here 'cause we love you
And when you finally open your eyes and ears
You'll see and you'll hear us singing

La, la, la, la, la, la
It's a beautiful world and we're all here
La, la, la, la, la, la
It's a beautiful world and we're all here
La, la, la, la, la, la
It's a beautiful world

You fell asleep under the starlit sea
It's time to wake up

The moon is high above you
We're all here 'cause we love you
And when you finally open your eyes and ears
You'll see and you'll hear us singing

La, la, la, la, la, la
It's a beautiful world and we're all here
La, la, la, la, la, la

TITLE: Never Find Someone Like You Lyrics
LYRICS:
Girl you take my breath away and when I'm with someone new
I'd rather be here with you baby, forever
My heart belongs to you 'cause I think about you all the time
I know my love is true when we're together

I've played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up, you were saying goodbye
I'm begging you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you

All I have is just my heart and my feelings, I give to you
That's all that I can do, give you forever, oh oh oh
You don't know that you're hurting me 'cause it's not just a sexual thang
I want to share my dreams, baby together

Girl, I'm afraid just to give you the love
My heart's still in need to hold back on my love
But when you get close, I just want you to know
I start to get weak I can't let you go

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you

Just your smile, tenderness
Girl, I won't let you down, won't let you down
Girl, I will never find no one that compares to you
Never find anyone

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you

TITLE: Tammy Lyrics
LYRICS:

Best Of Debbie Reynolds
Tammy
I hear the cottonwoods whisperin' above,
"Tammy ... Tammy ... Tammy's in love"
The ole hooty-owl hooty-hoos to the dove,
"Tammy ... Tammy ... Tammy's in love"

Does my lover feel
What I feel
When he comes near?
My heart beats so joyfully,
You'd think that he could hear

Wish I knew if he knew
What I'm dreamin' of
Tammy ... Tammy ... Tammy's in love

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know
Tammy ... Tammy ... can't let him go
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low:
"Tammy ... Tammy ... you love him so"

When the night is warm,
Soft and warm,
I long for his charms
I'd sing like a violin
If I were in his arms

Wish I knew if he knew
What I'm dreaming of
Tammy ... Tammy ... Tammy's in love

Note: From the 1957 film "Tammy and the Bachelor,"

Con Te Partiro
Quando sono solo
Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
Si lo so che non c'?luce
In una stanza quando manca il sole
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore
Che hai accesso
Chiudi dentro me
La luce
Che hai incontrato per strada.

Con te partiro
Paesi che non ho mai
Veduto e vissuto con te
Adesso si li vivr?
Con te partiro
Su navi per mari
Che io lo so
No no non esistono pi?
Con te io li rivivro.

Quando sei lontana
Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
E io si lo so
Che sei con me con me
Tu mia luna tu sei qui con me
Mio sole tu sei qui con me,
Con me, con me, con me.

Con te partiro
Paesi che non ho mai
Veduto e vissuto con te
Adesso s?li vivr?
Con te partir?
Su navi per mari

No no non esistono pi?
Con te io li rivivr?
Con te partir?
Su navi per mari

Con te io li rivivr?

TITLE: The Music Played Lyrics
LYRICS:
An angry silence stayed where love had been
And in your eyes a look I've never seen
If I had found the words you might have stayed
But as I turned to speak the music played

As lovers danced their way around the floor
I suddenly watched you walk towards the door
I heard a friend of yours suggest you stay
And as you took his hand the music played

Across the darkened room the fatal signs I saw
We'd been something more than friends before
Well, I was hurting you by clinging to my pride
He had been waiting and I drove him to your side

I couldn't say the things I should have said
Refused to let my heart control my head
But I was made to see the price I paid
And as he held you close the music played
And as I lost your love the music played

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary
When troubles come and my heart burdened be
Then I am still and wait here in the silence
Until you come and sit awhile with me

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up so I can stand on mountains
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas
I am strong when I am on your shoulders
You raise me up to more than I can be

You raise me up to walk on stormy seas

You raise me up to more than I can be

You're free as a roaring tide
So there's no need to hide

Born free and life is worth living
But only worth living
'Cause you're born free

Stay free, where no walls divide you
You're free as a roaring tide

Now he's leaning on my shoulder

Softly, I will leave you softly
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go
So I leave you softly, long before you miss me
Long before your arms can beg me stay
For one more hour or one more day
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall
So, softly as I leave you there

(Softly, long before you kiss me)
(Long before your arms can beg me stay)

TITLE: Makin' Whoopee Lyrics
LYRICS:
Every time I hear that dear old wedding march
I feel rather glad I have a broken arch
I have heard a lot of people talk
And I know that marriage is a long long walk

To most people
Weddings mean romance
But I prefer
A picnic or a dance

Another bride, another groom
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For making whoopee

The chorus sings, "Here comes the bride"
Another victim is by her side
He's lost his reason 'cause it's the season
For making whoopee

Down through the countless ages
You'll find it everywhere
Somebody makes good wages
Somebody wants her share

She calls him "Toodles" and rolls her eyes
She makes him strudles and bakes him pies
What is it all for?
It's so he'll fall for making whoopee

Another year or maybe less
What's this I hear, well, can't you guess?
She feels neglected, so he's suspected
Of making whoopee

She sits alone most every night
He doesn't phone or even write
He says he's busy, but she says, "Is he?"
He's making whoopee

He doesn't make much money
Five thousand dollars per
Some judge who thinks he's funny
Says, "You'll pay six to her"

He says, "Now judge, suppose I fail?"
The judge says, "Budge right into jail"
You better keep her, you'll find it's cheaper
Than making whoopee

For your eyes only, I never need to hide
You can see so much in me, so much in me that's new
I never felt till I looked at you

For your eyes only, only for you
You'll see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The love I know you need in me, the fantasy you've freed in me
Only for you, only for you

For your eyes only, the nights are never cold
You really know me, that's all I need to know
Maybe I'm an open book because I know you're mine
But you won't need to read between the lines

For your eyes only, only for you
You see what no-one else can see and now I'm breaking free
For your eyes only, only for you
The passions that collide in me, the wild abandoned side of me
Only for you, for your eyes only

Aba Daba Honeymoon
(Chorus): "Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab" means
"Monk, I love but you"
"Aba daba dab," in monkey talk,
Means "Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon,
They went upon their aba daba honeymoon

Way down in the Congo land,
Lived a happy chimpanzee
She loved a monkey,
with a long tail,
Lordy, how she loved him!

Each night he would find her there,
Swinging in the coconut tree
And the monkey, gay
At the break of day,
Loved to hear his chimp-y say:

"Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba"
Said the chimp-y to the monk
"Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba"
Said the monkey to the chimp
All night long, they'd chatter away,
All day long they were happy and gay
Swingin' and singin' in a honky-tonky way

"Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba" means:
"Monk, I love but you"
"Aba daba dab," in monkey talk, means:
"Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon
They went upon their aba daba honeymoon

(Faster): "Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba"
Said the chimp-y to the monk
"Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba"
Said the monkey to the chimp
All night long, they'd chatter away
All day long they were happy and gay
Swingin' and singin' in a honky-tonky way

"Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba" means:
"Monk, I love but you"
"Aba daba daba," in monkey talk, means:
"Chimp, I love you too"
Then the big baboon, one night in June
He married them, and very soon
They went upon their aba daba honeymoon

Then the big baboon, one night in June,
He married them, and very soon
They went upon their aba daba honey . . .
Aba daba, aba daba, aba daba honeymoon

Don't worry about that extra line
That's creeping up upon your face
It's just a part of nature's way to say you've grown a little more
Trees have rings and thicker branches
Kids shoes get a little tighter
Every year we're getting closer to who we're gonna be
It's time to celebrate the story of how you've come to be

Happy Birthday, my friend
Here's to all the years we've shared together
All the fun we've had
You're such a blessing
Such a joy in my life
May the good Lord bless you
And may all your dreams come true

So light a candle on your cake
For every smile you've helped create
For every heart and every soul you've helped to grow
A little more
A few more pounds, a little more grey
Don't count the years, just count the way
It takes a little time to go from water into wine
Don't ever lose the wonder of that child within your eyes

Happy Birthday, my friend
Here's to all the years we've shared together
All the fun we've had
You're such a blessing
Such a joy in my life
May the good Lord bless you

Walk away, just go

Walk away, and live
A life that's full
With no regret
Don't look back at me
Just try to forget
Why build a dream that cannot come true
So be strong, reach the stars now
Walk away, walk on

If I heard your voice
I'd beg you to stay
So don't say a word
Just run, run away

Goodbye my love
My tears will fall
Now that you've gone

Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your lips red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
How I'd leave in autumn, I never would know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, it couldn't it be in springtime
Knowing how in spring, I'm bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
No never, could I leave you at all

And could I leave you
Running merrily through the snow
Or on a wintry evening
When you catch the fire's glow

If ever I would leave you, how could it be in springtime
