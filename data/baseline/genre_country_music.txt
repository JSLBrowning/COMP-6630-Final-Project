LYRICS:
The moon outside, too bright, those blinds, yeah lets just keep them closed,
You know, my hands they know where to go, to find your finger tips,
Trace them back to your lips, take you on a trip, flip that switch

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing your doing there, brush me with your hair, I swear
I don't know how long that I can last,
Make my world go black, black, make my world black, black

Like your dress on the floor, yeah the one you don't need anymore,
Black like a sky with no stars, just find me and fall into my arms

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing your doing there, brush me with your hair, I swear
I don't know how long that I can last,
Make my world go black, black, make my world black, black

I don't wanna see a thing, baby I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush,
I don't wanna see a thing, I just wanna feel your love

Make my world go black, hit me like a heart attack, knock me flat on my back, yeah
Just keep doing that, that thing your doing there, brush me with your hair, I swear
I don't know how long that I can last,
Make my world go black, black, make my world black, black

Make my world go black
I don't wanna see a thing, I just wanna feel your touch, feel your rush

LYRICS:
Why do you keep on staring?
That mirror, mirror, it ain't fair at all (mm-mm)
Dress sizes can't define, don't let the world decide what's beautiful
No

You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Don't follow anyone,
March to the rhythm of a different drum
Why do we analyze, break out, and criticize the crazy ones?
Oh

You won't make yourself a name if you follow the rules
History gets made when you're acting a fool
So don't hold it back and just run it
Show what you got and just own it
No, they can't tear you apart, no

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Put your hands up, show me that you're one of a kind
Put your hands up, let me hear your voice tonight
Oh

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

If you trust your rebel heart, ride it into battle
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled
Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on
Oh, ooh-whoa, oh, ooh-whoa
Take the road less traveled on

Wear out your boots and kick up the gravel
Don't be afraid, take the road less traveled on

Traveled on
Take the road less traveled on

LYRICS:
You leave in the morning
With everything you own in a little black case
Alone on the platform
The wind and the rain
On a sad and lonely face

Mother will never understand
Why you had to leave
For the answer you seek
Will never be found at home
The love that you need
Will never be found at home

Pushed around and kicked around
Always a lonely boy

You were the one
That they'd talk about around town
As they put you down
And as hard as they would try
They'd hurt to make you cry

But you'd never cry to them
Just to your soul
No you'd never cry to them
Just to your soul

feat. Carrie Underwood

I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
Cause your precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh, oh, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter
What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I promise I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
It's a love like you never knew
Just let me show you

What if I fall?
I won't let you fall
What if I cry?
I'll never make you cry
And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

And if I get scared?
I'll hold you tighter
When they're tryna get to you baby I'll be the fighter

I wanna believe that you got me baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart

LYRICS:
On a boat, on a beach
In the water, in the sand, in the back of a bar
Cold beer in your hand
Breaking hearts, breaking necks
When we rolling down the street, heads turning all day when they see you with me
I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

They're like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Aw baby you look good

Black dress, 2 the 9s, New Year's in a pent
From the floor, to the roof, make the skyline spin
Yeah, you're killing me boy in your black-faded jeans
Ain't gotta work hard when you're smilin' at me

Like, "hey, who that there with the shades?"
Like oh, the way you move to the bass
Hold up
Whole room gets to spinnin' from the second that you walk in
And baby you look good all day, all night
You look good, so fresh, so fine
You look good, got everybody watching you like cameras in Hollywood
Baby you look good
Aw baby you look good

I'm thinking everybody better stand in line
'Cause they need to know that your body's coming with me tonight

LYRICS:
Got a girl from the south side, got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell off my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet
It ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

We're out here in the boondocks
With the breeze and the birds
Tangled up in the tall grass
With my lips on hers
On the highway to heaven
Headed south of her smile
Get there when we get there
Every inch is a mile

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' 15 in a 30, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

I'ma take it slow
As fast as I can
Body like a back road
Drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand

[Verse 1]
She looks so pretty with no makeup on
You should hear her talking to her mama on the phone
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl


[Verse 2]
Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Making all the guys wish that you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl

[Bridge]
Yeah, that's my girl
In my truck, in the songs that I sing with the radio up
My girl
In my heart, in my soul and the air that I breathe every day
That's my girl
Yeah, everything

That's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancing around, causing a scene

LYRICS:
What if I told you about my little nothing town
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
Cause everybody's already tried

Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I'd blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, cause you love me anyway?

What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them

So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do

If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I'd blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way cause you love me anyway?
Cause you love me anyway

So before we go any further here
Better we turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't want to hear
But you have to

If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this I don't want to let it slip away
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway?

LYRICS:
She grew up around here on that southwest side Where the corn grows up to the road side
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

She couldn't hide her beauty with a baseball cap Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that
New York called when she turned 21 But she never forgot where she came from
I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

Her mamma's mamma was born right here And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl but she's not uptight She can rise and shine and she can hang all night

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

She's got an old soul, she's the salt of the earth When she gives her love she knows what it's worth
There's a lot of pretty girls out there to me But there's nothing like the one right across the street

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

I need a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

[Verse 1: Florida Georgia Line]
That Sunday morning choir calling, church doors open wide
That hallelujah, shoot right through ya, make you feel alive
That key under the mat, you know right where it's at
It's waiting with the porch light on
Don't bother calling, no need for knocking, just come on home
Come on home, my love is

Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than
God, your mama, and me
God, your mama, and me
Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me

Loud as shotgun, angels singing with the radio
Praying with you every mile down any dead end road
You can tell me every secret that you been keeping
I'll hold it, lock and key
Up with you all night, holding you all night, I never leave
You better believe my love is

[Chorus: Florida Georgia Line & Backstreet Boys]
Never gonna run dry, never gonna come up empty
Now until the day I die, unconditionally
You know I'm always gonna be here for ya
No one's ever gonna love you more than

Unconditionally, God, your mama, and me
You better believe it, you better believe it

Every move you make, you know I'm part of you wherever you go

Been up since the crack of dawn
Just trying to paid
Been hotter than a thousand suns
I can't find no shade
Just two more roads and I'm good to go
Yeah, I'm shutting this tractor down
Get me a half an hour for a shave or a shower
And I'll be outside your house

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots
[Verse 2]
Hard as I worked all day
I'm gonna work harder loving on you
Spin you all over that dance floor
Right out of them high heel shoes
And when you're ready to quit
Baby, we can slip right out of that barroom door
And when I take you home, don't worry babe
I'm gonna kick them off on the porch

[Chorus]
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels
But they're gonna shine with you're up inside
Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug
Burn it up like neon lights
Might have a little dirt on my boots
But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight
Got a little dirt on my boots

A little dirty dancing, blue collar romancing
I can get cleaned up if you ask me
But I can only get so fancy

Might have a little dirt on my boots
But I'm taking you uptown tonight
Might have a little mud on my wheels

[Verse 1]
I wonder if Jack and Diane ever made it
After the drums and the guitars all faded
Was the best they could do good enough?
Or did the heartland just swallow 'em up?
How did my mom and my dad ever do it?
If there was struggles, then we never knew it
I guess they had each other
That was enough

[Chorus]
You know you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

[Verse 2]
What am I gonna tell my kids when they see all of this bullshit that goes down on TV?
When the whole world is down on its luck
I gotta make sure they keep their chin up
Cry when it hurts, laugh when it's funny
Chase after the dream, don't chase after the money
And no we got each other
That's what's up

[Chorus]
Cause you can't keep the ground from shaking
No matter how hard you try
You can't keep the sunsets from fading
You gotta treat your life like you're jumping off a rope swing
Baby cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

Baby cause the whole thing's really just a shot in the dark
You gotta love like there's no such thing as a broken heart

One more might, one more down
One more, one more round
First one in, last one out

Giving this town lots to talk about
They don't know what they don't know

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People sayin' that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call a problem, I call a solution

Last call gets later and later
I come in here so I don't have to hate her
Same old folks, same old songs
Same old, same old blew me off
The same old buzz, just because

People say I've got a drinkin' problem
That ain't no reason to stop
People sayin' that I've hit rock bottom
Just cause I'm living on the rocks
It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem
But I got no problem drinkin' at all

They keep on talkin'
Drawing conclusions
They call a problem, I call a solution

Sitting here in all my grand illusions
They call it a problem, I call it a solution

Just a solution

It's a broken hearted thinkin' problem
So pull that bottle off the wall
People say I got a drinkin' problem

She don't give a damn 'bout your Benjamin Franklins
She wants Aretha
She don't really care how you're spending your money
It's all how you treat her
She just want a friend to be there
When she opens her eyes in the morning
She wants you to say what you mean and mean everything that you're saying

[Chorus: Faith Hill]
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
That's how you speak to a girl
That’s how you get with the lady who’s worth more than anything in your whole world
You better respect your Mama
Respect the hell out of her
'Cause that's how you talk to a woman
And that's how you speak to a girl

[Verse 2: Tim McGraw]
She don't give a damn 'bout your pride or the lies that you're hiding behind
She just want to feel that you're real
That she's near to the man that's inside
She don't need to hear she's a queen on a throne
That she's more than amazing
She just wants you to say what you mean and to mean everything that you're saying

I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

[Verse 1]
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn't 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun
Boy, you never thought I'd run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye

And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

LYRICS:
Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane

Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking bout us again
If I woulda just layed my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house

But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

You hit me category five
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright
But just your sight had my heart storming
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane

LYRICS:
He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man

Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

My old man

LYRICS:
I can see you over there
Starring at your drink
Watchin’ that ice sink
All alone tonight

And chances are
You’re sittin’ here in this bar
‘Cause he ain’t gonna treat you right
Well, it’s probably not my place
But I’m gonna say it anyway
‘Cause you look like
You haven’t felt the fire
Had a little fun
Hadn’t had a smile in a little while
Baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darling, it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white
He’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color

I’m not tryna
Be another just
Pick you up
Kinda guy
Tryna drink you up
Tryna take you home
But I just don’t understand
How another man
Can take your sun
And turn it ice cold

Well, I’ve had enough to drink
And it’s makin’
Me think that I just might
Tell you if I were a painter I wouldn’t change ya
I’d just paint you bright
Baby

Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darling, it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white
He’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
Blue looks good on the sky
Looks good on that neon buzzin’ on the wall
But darling, it don’t match your eyes
I’m tellin’ you
You don’t need that guy
It’s so black and white
He’s stealin’ your thunder
Baby, blue ain’t your color
