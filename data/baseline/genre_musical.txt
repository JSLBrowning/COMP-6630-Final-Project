Sisters
Sisters
Sisters
There were never such devoted sisters

Never had to have a chaperone "No, sir"
I'm there to keep my eye on her

Caring
Sharing
Every little thing that we are wearing

When a certain gentleman arrived from Rome
She wore the dress and I stayed home

All kinds of weather
We stick together
The same in the rain or sun
Two diff'rent faces
But in tight places
We think and we act as one

Those who've 
Seen us
Know that not a thing could come between us

Many men have tried to split us up but no one can
Lord help the mister 
Who comes between me and my sister
And Lord help the sister
Who comes between me and my man

TITLE: I'm Still Here Lyrics
LYRICS:
Good times and bum times, I've seen them all, and, my dear, 
I'm still here.
Plush velvet sometimes, sometimes just pretzels and beer, 
but I'm here.
I've stuffed the dailies in my shoes,
strummed ukuleles, sung the blues.
Seen all my dreams disappear,
but I'm here.

I've slept in shanties, guest of the W.P.A., 
and I'm here.
Danced in my scanties, three bucks a night was the pay, 
and I'm here.
I've stood on bread lines with the best,
watched while the headlines did the rest.
In the depression was I depressed? Nowhere near. 
I met a big financier, 
and I'm here.

I've been through Gandhi, Windsor and Wally's affair, 
and I'm here.
Amos 'n' Andy, mah-jongg and platinum hair, 
and I'm here.
I got through Abie's Irish Rose, five Dionne babies, Major Bowes,
Had heebie-jeebies for Beebe's Bathysphere.
I got through Shirley Temple, 
and I'm here

I've gotten through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover;
gee, that was fun and a half!
When you've been through Herbert and J. Edgar Hoover,
anything else is a laugh.

I've been through Reno, I've been through Beverly Hills, 
and I'm here.
Reefers and vino, rest cures, religion and pills, 
but I'm here.
Been called a "pinko-commie tool," got through it stinko by my pool.
I should've gone to an acting school, that seems clear.
Still, someone said, "She's sincere," 
so I'm here.

Black sable one day, next day it goes into hock, 
but I'm here.
Top billing Monday, Tuesday you're touring in stock, 
but I'm here.
First you're another sloe-eyed vamp, then someone's mother, then you're camp;
then you career from career to career.
I'm almost through my memoirs, 
and I'm here.

I've gotten through "Hey, lady, aren't you whoozis?
Wow, what a looker you were."
Or better yet, "Sorry, I thought you were whoozis;
Whatever happened to her?"

Good times and bum times, I've seen 'em all, and, my dear, 
I'm still here.
Plush velvet sometimes, sometimes just pretzels and beer, 
but I'm here.
I've run the gamut, A to Z;
three cheers and, dammit, c'est la vie.
I got through all of last year, 
and I'm here.
Lord knows, at least I've been there, and I'm here. 
Look who's here. 
I'm still here.

LYRICS:
I saw something sitting on your bed
I saw something touching your head
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep, where you sleep

You better run, you better run
You better hide, you better hide
You better run

I saw something sitting on your bed
I saw something touching your head
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep, where you sleep

You better run, you better run
You better hide, you better hide

There's something in the shadows
In the corner of your room
A dark heart is beating and waiting for you
There is no open window but the floors still creep
In the room where you sleep
In the room where you sleep, where you sleep

You better run, you better run
You better hide, you better hide

Oh, you better run

LYRICS:
[Charlotte]
Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A frail and fluffy beauty.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer
A solid girl like me?

[Gabrielle]
She's a frothy little bubble,
with a flimsy kind of charm.
And with very little trouble,
I could break her little arm!
Oh

[Charlottle]
Oh,

[Both]

Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
So obviously unusual.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer, a usual girl like me?

[Charlotte]
Her cheeks are a pretty shade of pink.

[Gabrielle]
But no more pinker than a rose's.

[Charlotte]
Her skin may be delicate and soft.

[Gabrielle]
But not any softer than a doe's is!

[Charlotte]
Her neck is no whiter than a swan.

[Gabrielle]
She's only a dainty as a daisy.

[Charlotte]
She's only as graceful as a bird.

[Both]
So why is a feller' going crazy?
Oh, why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A girl whose merely lovely.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer, a girl whose merely me?

[Gabrielle]
She's a frothy little bubble,
with a frilly sort of air!

[Charlotte]
And with very little trouble,
I could pull out all her hair!

[Both]
Oh, oh!
Why would a fellow want a girl like her?
A girl whose merely lovely.
Why can't a fellow ever once prefer, a girl whose merely me

What's a matter with a man?
What's a matter witch a man?
What's a matter with a man?!

Not a day goes by,
Not a single day
But you're somewhere a part of my life
And it looks like you'll stay.
As the days go by,
I keep thinking, "When does it end?
Where 's the day I'll have started forgetting?"
But I just go on
Thinking and sweating
And cursing and crying
And turning and reaching
And waking and dying

And no,
Not a day goes by,
Not a blessed day.
But you're still somewhere part of my life
And you won't go away.
So there's hell to pay.
And until I die
I'll die day after day
After day after day
After day after day
After day
Till the days go by
Till the days go by
Till the days go by

Ten Minutes Ago I saw you, 
I looked up when you came through the door 
My head started reeling, You gave me the feeling 
the room had no ceiling or floor. 
Ten Minutes ago, I met you 
and we murmered our how-do-you do's, 
I wanted to ring out the bells and fling out my arms 
and to sing out the news. 
I have found her! She's an angel 
with the dust of the stars in her eyes. 
We are dancing, we are flying 
and she's taking me back to the skies. 
In the arms of my love I'm flying 
over mountain and meadow and glen 
And I like it so well that for all I can tell 
I may never come down again!  I may never come down to earth again.

Snowball throwing
That's what I'll do
How I'm longing to ski
Through the

Those glist'ning houses that seem to be built of snow

Oh, to see a mountain covered with a quilt of snow

What is Christmas with no snow
No white Christmas with no snow

I'll soon be there with snow
I'll wash my hair with snow

Someone to hold me too close.
Someone to hurt me too deep.
Someone to sit in my chair,
And ruin my sleep,
And make me aware,
Of being alive.
Being alive.

Somebody need me too much.
Somebody know me too well.
Somebody pull me up short,
And put me through hell,
And give me support,
For being alive.
Make me alive.
Make me alive.

Make me confused.
Mock me with praise.
Let me be used.
Vary my days.

But alone,
Is alone,
Not alive.

Somebody crowd me with love.
Somebody force me to care.
Somebody let me come through,
I'll always be there,
As frightened as you,
To help us survive,
Being alive.
Being alive.
Being alive!

TITLE: Ladies Who Lunch Lyrics
LYRICS:
Here's to the ladies who lunch--
Everybody laugh.
Lounging in their caftans
And planning a brunch
On their own behalf.
Off to the gym,
Then to a fitting,
Claiming they're fat.
And looking grim,
'Cause they've been sitting
Choosing a hat.
Does anyone still wear a hat?
I'll drink to that.

And here's to the girls who play smart--
Aren't they a gas?
Rushing to their classes
In optical art,
Wishing it would pass.
Another long exhausting day,
Another thousand dollars,
A matinee, a Pinter play,
Perhaps a piece of Mahler's.
I'll drink to that.
And one for Mahler!

And here's to the girls who play wife--
Aren't they too much?
Keeping house but clutching
A copy of LIFE,
Just to keep in touch.
The ones who follow the rules,
And meet themselves at the schools,
Too busy to know that they're fools.
Aren't they a gem?
I'll drink to them!
Let's all drink to them!

And here's to the girls who just watch--
Aren't they the best?
When they get depressed,
It's a bottle of Scotch,
Plus a little jest.
Another chance to disapprove,
Another brilliant zinger,
Another reason not to move,
Another vodka stinger.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
I'll drink to that.

So here's to the girls on the go--
Everybody tries.
Look into their eyes,
And you'll see what they know:
Everybody dies.
A toast to that invincible bunch,
The dinosaurs surviving the crunch.
Let's hear it for the ladies who lunch--
Everybody rise!
Rise!
Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!
Rise!

     When the fight was all through
     But he knew just what to do
     Crawling through the mud
     So I've heard it said

     He made a tidy score
     From the spoils of war

     My den of dissolutes

     Homing pigeons homing in
     Then fly through my doors
     And their money's as good as yours

     What he put in this stew
     Must have scraped it off the street

     Chateau Neuf de Turpentine
     Must have pressed it with his feet
     Landlord over here!

     Reasonable charges
     Plus some little extras on the side!
     Charge 'em for the lice
     Extra for the mice
     Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
     Here a little slice
     There a little cut
     Three percent for sleeping with the window shut

     Everybody bless his spouse!

Mme. Thenardier

All
     Everybody raise a glass to the master of the house!

TITLE: A Lovely Night Lyrics
LYRICS:
[Cinderella: {*spoken}]
I imagine that there's a grand staircase*
candles everywhere, and an orchestra playing... 

[Minerva:]
It looks that way 

[Calliope:]
The way you say 

[Stepmother:]
She talks as if she knows. 

[Cinderella:]
I do not know that this is so 
I only just suppose... 
I suppose that when you come to the ballroom 
And the room itself is floating in the air 
If you're suddenly confronted by his highness 
You are frozen like a statue on the stair 
You're afraid he'll hear the way your heart is beating 
And you know you mustn't make the first advance.
You are seriously thinking of retreating 
When you seem to hear him asking you to dance... 
{*spoken}
And when you waltz with him, you whirl around so that your feet never 
touch the floor... 

[Calliope:]
That's right they don't! 

[Cinderlla:]
And it feels like you weigh nothing at all 

[Minerva:] 
That's right it does! 

[Cinderella:]
And for a few precious moments, you're the only two people in the entire 
world. 
(sings) 
A Lovely night, a lovely night 
A finer night you know you'll never see 
You meet your prince, a charming prince 
As charming as a prince will ever be. 
The stars in a hazy heaven 
tremble above you 
While he is whispering: 
"Darling I Love you" 
You say goodbye, away you fly 
but on your lips you keep a kiss 
All your life you'll dream of this 
Lovely, lovely night. 

[Minerva:]
A Lovely night, 

[Calliope:]
How lovely! 

[Minevra:]
A lovely night 

[Calliope:]
How lovely! 

[Minerva:]
A finer night you know you'll never see 

[Calliope:]
How lovely. 
Minerva: 
You meet... 

[Calliope:]
your prince, 

[Minerva:]
a char-... 

Calliope:   
..ming prince. 

Stepmother: 
As charming as a prince will ever be. 
The stars in a hazy heaven 

Calliope:   
tremble above you 

Stepmother: 
While he is whispering: 

Minerva: 
"Darling I Love you" 

Cinderella: 
You say goodbye, away you fly 

Stepsisters: 
but on your lips you keep a kiss 

Stepmother: 
All your life you'll dream of this 

Cinderella: 
Lovely, 

Minerva: 
lovely, 

Calliope:   
lovely 
Stepsisters, Cinderella: 
Lovely night!

LYRICS:
Rodgers And Hammerstein
Cinderella
My Own Little Corner
I'm as mild and as meek as a mouse 
When I hear a command I obey 
But I know of a spot in my house 
Where no one can stand in my way 
In my own little corner in my own little chair 
I can be whatever I want to be 
On the wing of my fancy I can fly anywhere 
and the world will open it's arms to me 
I'm a young egyptian princess or a milkmaid 
I'm the greatest prima donna in Milan 
I'm a heiress who has always had her silk made 
by her own flock of silkworms in Japan 
I'm a girl men go mad for love's a game I can play 
with a cool and confident kind of air 
Just as long as I stay in my own little corner 
All alone, in my own, little chair. 

(Cinderella I'm Thirsty! You're Thirsty! Cinderella where's our tea?!) 

I can be whatever I want to be.... 
I'm a thief in Calcutta 
I'm a queen in Peru 
I'm a mermaid dancing upon the sea 
I'm a huntress on an African Safari 
It's a dangerous type of sport and yet it's fun 
In the night I sally forth to seek my quarry 
and I find I forgot to bring my gun! 
I am lost in the jungle all alone and unarmed 
when I meet a lioness in her lair! 
Then I'm glad to be back in my own little corner 
All alone, in my own, little chair.
