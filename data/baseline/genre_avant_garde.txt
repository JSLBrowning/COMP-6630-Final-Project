You and me are the new twin of myself
Eating seeds from the big black cloud above us
Let me be with the new twin of myself

TITLE: I Will Be Silent Lyrics
LYRICS:


I will be silent and wait for you
My heart will be quiet as I wait for you

Only one thing is required
To be sitting at your feet
And the more that I am near you
The more the world just seems so plain.

TITLE: Lofticries (Single) Lyrics
LYRICS:
Bring, bring the thunder
And the loud, loud rain
Lead our woes asunder
'Neath the proud, proud veins

Of traits that bleed the gunmen
Of our pumping, earthly hearts
Ween our joys in plunder
Feel our shining teeth
Bet our hold on happiness

Bead-weighted chests with lofticries
Lofticries with trembling thighs
Weepy chests with weepy sighs
Weepy skin with trembling thighs

You must be hovering over yourself
Watching us trip on each other's sides
Dear brother, collect all the liquids off of the floor
Use your oily fingers
Make a paste, let it form

Let it seep through your sockets and earholes
Into your precious, fractured skull
Let it seep, let it keep you from us
Patiently heal you
Patiently unreel you

Bead-weighted chests with lofticries
Lofticries with trembling thighs
Weepy chests with weepy sighs
Weepy skin with trembling thighs

You must be hovering over yourself
Watching us trip on each other's sides
Dear brother, collect all the liquids off of the floor
Use your oily fingers
Pick up paste, let it form

(Lofticries)

Bead-weighted chests with lofticries
Lofticries with trembling thighs
Weepy chests with weepy sighs
Weepy skin with trembling thighs

(Lofticries)

You must be hovering over yourself
Watching us trip on each other's sides

TITLE: Something I Was Not Lyrics
LYRICS:
I have some love 
But not enough
To pull me over
Where dark meets day.

You were something that I was not
When I was dying, you've pulled me up
And I was guilty
These filthy stains on my hands
I should be bleeding, I should be...

Walk inside my skin, you... (x3)
Look inside my heart, you...
Walk inside my skin, you...
Look inside my heart, you...
Walk inside my skin.

TITLE: What Use? Lyrics
LYRICS:
What's the use of feeling betrayed?
What's the use of feeling at all?
I'm pacing the floor, I'm wearing it smooth
This is stupid, I think I'll go home

What's the use of moving uptown?
Fly to Rome on your credit card
An endless parade of lawyers and finance
Plenty of time with nothing to do

Give me new noise, give me new affection
Strange new toys from another world
I need to see more than just three dimension
Stranger than fiction faster than light

TITLE: I Whipped Spiderman's Ass Lyrics
LYRICS:
Spiderman thought he was bad
He was screwin' my date up
He was botherin' my girlfriend
He tried to cut her out of seventy dollars

I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass

Spiderman messed with my girlfriend
Spiderman wrapped his arms around her
With my bedroom door closed

Suddenly, I opened the bedroom door
On Spiderman's sneaky ass
I caught him kissing my girlfriend
And beat him to a pulp with a rubber hose

I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass

Spiderman beat the hell out of me
He whirled me and knocked me to the floor
I tore out his world and threw him against the radiator
Spiderman was being such a stupid jerk

I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass
I whipped Spiderman's ass

Rock over London
Rock on, Chicago
Napa, it's the parts store

TITLE: Ungirthed (Single) Lyrics
LYRICS:
The scent of my hands is familiar
To prostrated men in their call
To gargle on their spirits from fire, fire, fire, fire
Who speak with so tenderly
Who speak with, so tenderly coax

The tinge of my eyes is familiar
To prostrated men in their call
To get close, close, close
To their closetly homes
Illuminate the words of the ghosts

Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears, ears
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears, ears ring

The air is familiar
So is that smell
Dead voices cover their mouths
Refill their quotas
With vessels of earth
And cry in detritioning bones

Dust off my necklace, familiar
To culminated piles,
To the culminated piles of bones
That shift when the earth quakes
It trembles, trembles
And call these men up to their,
And call these men up to their thrones

The scent of my skin is familiar
To prostrated men in their call
To gargle on their spirits from fire, fire, fire, fire
Who speak with so tenderly
Who speak with so tenderly, coax

The air is familiar
So is that smell
Dead voices cover their mouths
And refill their quotas
With vessels of earth

Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ringing, teeth clicking
Ears ears ring

Knocking on my door

But you won't come in til' I let you in

Knocking on my door

But you won't come in until I say

Paper house
To my

To my
Paper house

Standing on my lawn
with the scissors in your hands
and you could come in where you'd like

To my
Paper house
To my

To my

Rain's falling now
soaking right through these walls
I can see the sun it's shining

Rain's falling now
soaking right through these walls
I can see your form outside
of my

TITLE: Tantrum Lyrics
LYRICS:
Save your arms and legs cause you’re the mother and no one will hold us up for so long. We will always resort to fodder. We crawl in the crack, falling through your limbs. If she was here, she’d say be careful but she’d already let it go.
Do as I say, not as I’ve done. Just trust in me. Believe me.
When you left me, you didn’t leave me a trail to follow. No, you just swallowed all the crumbs along the way so you could feed all the ghosts that hide inside your bones cause maybe if their mouths are full they’ll stop whispering that you’re better off alone.
It wasn’t nice of you to go out without saying goodbye. So I think I’ll hunt you down and punish you. Good luck trying to hide. My temper’s a teacher with a hell of a lesson plan.
You might know this but I’ve got a rifle and stifling manners. You control this and any consistency scares me from progress. I don’t show it but I’m catching on and can see through the pattern. Don’t talk! Read this! Your strong upper hand will get lost in the process.
Got matters to attend to and methods to convince you to stay right where you
Are you ready to apologize? I won’t believe you but it’s worth a few tries. Don’t look down! Look in my eyes! Go on and feed me some lies. Lie to me!
I make this into what you always keep from me.
Although your secrets are locked away, you forget that you left me a key on a day that’s just memory; when we were young and were happy. When lying on the bed with not a thing to do and words unsaid, we were certain that things were perfect. Of course I’m bitter thinking things would never change. I can’t let go and this is why I always make this into what you keep from me.

TITLE: You Can Count On Me Lyrics
LYRICS:
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it

Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it

Know you can count on me
I'll be so up for it
Know at least I'll try

Who are you if you're not up for it
When are you if I'm not up for it

Wanna put a bubble round you
Like a force field switch
Keep you secure just a little bit

But I know a secret child
Is just a silly trick
Who grows up to lose
That force field switch

In between a hands on
And a hands off apprenticeship
Where are you if I'm not up for it
I'll wake up for it

Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
Know you can count on me
To get so up for it

Know you can count on me
I'll get so up for it
Know at least I'll try

TITLE: Last Night At The Jetty Lyrics
LYRICS:
Dreams that we once had
Did we have them anyways?
Seems that we once had
Now we'll have them all the time

Didn't we, didn't we
Didn't we have a good time?
I know we, I know we
I know we had a real time

Now who could say
We're not just as we were
No one could deny my mind

I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know

I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know

I don't want to describe something that I'm not
I don't want to hide the hopes that I have
I want to enjoy what's meant to enjoy
But I try to but it flies and swerves to the floor

Say what you will
And we're lucky if I start to
I know I could not go
Even if I had the eyes to try

You have your ways
I have my ways
We have our ways

And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend

And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend
And I'll call you my friend

Dreams that I once had
Did I have them anyways?
Seems that I once had
Now I'll have them all the time

Didn't I, didn't I
Didn't I have a good time?
I know I, I know I
I know I had a real time

Now who could say
I'm not just as I was
No one could deny my mind
