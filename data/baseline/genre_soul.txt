TITLE: There Is A Way Lyrics
LYRICS:
You say love is just a word, just four letters in a row
Just a thing that people say or they never tell you so
And you use every excuse to let nobody in
Now this cloud you bring around has become your only friend

And everybody saying that it's going to go away but it don't go
And everybody's telling you one day it's going to change
But you don't know if it's really going to end

But there is a way, there is a spark
There is a hope that you can hold on to
There is a lifeline come to the rescue
Just like a hand that's waiting for you
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone
There is a way, the truth and the life, and the way

But if love became a man if the word had flesh and bone
Would you recognize His face if He came to bring you home?
You think you're all alone, gotta do it on your own riding solo
Is there someone you can call when you stumble and fall?
'Cause you don't know if you'll be getting up again

There is a way, there is a spark
There is a hope that you can hold on to
There is a lifeline come to the rescue
Just like a hand that's waiting for you
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone
There is a way, the truth and the life, and the way

Don't you think your life's worth saving?
Don't you know that love's amazing?
Don't you want to lay your troubles down?
Lay them down

If I thought love was just a word, I might feel the same way too
But there's so much more than that and it's waiting here for you

There is a way, there is a spark
There is a hope that you can hold on to
There is a lifeline come to the rescue
Just like a hand that's waiting for you
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone

There is a way, there is a way, there is a way
(Truth and the life and the way)
Come on, there is a way
(Truth and the life and the way)
There is a way, there is a way
(Truth and the life and the way)

There is a way
(Truth and the life and the way)
Ooh, there is a way back home
(Truth and the life and the way)

TITLE: How To Make Gravy Lyrics
LYRICS:
Hello Dan, it's Joe here, I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behavior, I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day
Please don't let 'em cry for me

I guess the brothers are driving down
From Queensland and Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees
Even more maybe, but that won't stop the roast

Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour, salt, a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning
When I'm standing in line

I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend, I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
(Just a little too much cologne)
And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

Oh praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening, I can just imagine
You'll put on junior Murvin and push the tables back
And you'll dance with Rita, I know you really like her

Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact
You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me

I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat
Tell her that I'm sorry, yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry
And kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back

And jus' smile
Just take in some clean fresh air, boy
Ain't no sense in stayin' inside
If the weather's fine an' you got the time
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day
Either way
It's a beautiful mornin', ahhh
Each bird keeps singin' his own song
So long
I've got to be on my way, now
Ain't no fun just hangin' around
I've got to cover ground, you couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines
When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide
Ahhhh oh! (shouldn't hide) ah ah oh

(Do do waaa, do do waaa)

There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour
Seems to me that the people keep seeing
More and more each day, gotta say, lead the way
It's okay, wednesday, thursday, it's okay
(Ahhh) monday, wednesday, friday, weekday, ah ah ohhh

Wooooo oo oo oh oh oh ah wo do waa

Tell me where you hiding from me all the time?

Each time I try to find someone to take your place
It was all in vain, no their lips were never quite the same, no baby
When I was kissing someone new deep inside I was missing you

Oh baby, you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Oh honey, I looked out into empty space
And all I saw was your sweet face

Love, love, love
You can't imagine what you did to me, oh baby
And love, your love
Everytime you smile it goes through me all the time

Day by day I'm fallin more in love with you
And that's no lie, cross my heart and honey I hope to die
'Cuz I'm not tryin' to mislead you believe me girl I really need you

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
At a tombstone bar in a jukejoint car he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top

Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it, one for the road"

Lido, oh, oh, oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a waitin' for the go

Lido, oh, oh, oh
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it, one more for the road"

Lido be runnin' havin' great big fun
Until he got the note
Sayin', "Tow the line or blow it"
And that was all she wrote

He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the borderline, goin' for broke
Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it
This joint ain't nothin' to it, one more for the road"

Lido, oh, oh, oh
He's for the money, he's for the show

When they try to keep you happy, they just try to keep you satisfied

Mr. Big Stuff tell me, tell me
Who do you think you are

I'd rather give my love to a poor guy that has a love that's true
Than to be fooled around and get hurt by you
'Cause when I give my love, I want love in return

Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
Close your eyes and I'll be there

After all is said and done
After all you are the one
Take me up your stairs and through the door
Take me where we don't care anymore

I treated you unkindly, but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love
With holding nothing you came out in front when I was hiding
Now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody, 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you're a friend of mine

If I find someone to take away my trouble
Ring of sadness doing me

Well, I found the love I need a long time
I found the love to ease my troubled mind
Well, I found the love I need a long time

TITLE: From Little Things Big Things Grow Lyrics
LYRICS:
Gather round people, let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Vestey man said, I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said, uh uh, we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land

Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri, boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said, no thanks, we know how to wait

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege cannot move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
