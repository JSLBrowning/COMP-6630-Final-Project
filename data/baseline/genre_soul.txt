LYRICS:
Mr. Big Stuff
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love

Now because you wear all those fancy clothes
And have a big fine car, oh yes you do now
Do you think I can afford to give you my love
You think you're higher than every star above

Mr. Big Stuff
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love

Now I know all the girls I've seen you with
I know you broke their hearts one after another now, bit by bit
You made 'em cry, many poor girls cry
When they try to keep you happy, they just try to keep you satisfied

Mr. Big Stuff tell me, tell me
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love

I'd rather give my love to a poor guy that has a love that's true
Than to be fooled around and get hurt by you
'Cause when I give my love, I want love in return
Now I know this is a lesson Mr. Big Stuff you haven't learned

Mr. Big Stuff tell me
Who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love

Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna break my heart
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna make me cry

Mr. Big Stuff tell me
Just who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love

Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna break my heart
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna make me cry

Mr. Big Stuff tell me, tell me
Just who do you think you are
Mr. Big Stuff
You're never gonna get my love

LYRICS:
Gather round people, let me tell you're a story
An eight year long story of power and pride
British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri
Were opposite men on opposite sides

Vestey was fat with money and muscle
Beef was his business, broad was his door
Vincent was lean and spoke very little
He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Gurindji were working for nothing but rations
Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter
Gurindju decided they must make a stand

They picked up their swags and started off walking
At Wattie Creek they sat themselves down
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking
Back at the homestead and then in the town

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Vestey man said, I'll double your wages
Seven quid a week you'll have in your hand
Vincent said, uh uh, we're not talking about wages
We're sitting right here till we get our land

Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered
You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow
Vince said if we fall others are rising

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri, boarded an aeroplane
Landed in Sydney, big city of lights
And daily he went round softly speaking his story
To all kinds of men from all walks of life

And Vincent sat down with big politicians
This affair they told him is a matter of state
Let us sort it out, your people are hungry
Vincent said, no thanks, we know how to wait

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane
Back to his country once more to sit down
And he told his people let the stars keep on turning
We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns

Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting
Till one day a tall stranger appeared in the land
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony
And through Vincent's fingers poured a handful of sand

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

That was the story of Vincent Lingairri
But this is the story of something much more
How power and privilege cannot move a people
Who know where they stand and stand in the law

From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow
From little things big things grow

LYRICS:
Your tear drops fade and then I saw
Your hands in the pocket
'Cause you were always made to want it all
But now you got to make it on your own
This ain't your home

So I'm shown' you the door
Wave goodbye
Now it's time for you to go

Don't come back anytime
I've already had your kind
This is you pay back
Moneygrabber

Don't come back anytime
You've already robbed me blind
This is you pay back
Moneygrabber

Through rhinestone glass
All I see
You talkin' double like the time
You said could you buy it for me

'Cause I'm in trouble
Here's my advice
I don't pay twice
For the price of a cheap dime whore

Don't come back anytime
I've already had your kind
This is you pay back
Moneygrabber

Don't come back anytime
You've already robbed me blind
This is you pay back
Moneygrabber

One, two, three
One is for the money
Two is for the greed
Three time that I told you
That you're the one I just don't need

Don't come back anytime
I've already had your kind
This is you pay back
Moneygrabber

Don't come back anytime
You've already robbed me blind
This is you pay back

LYRICS:
Hello Dan, it's Joe here, I hope you're keeping well
It's the 21st of December
And now they're ringing the last bells
If I get good behavior, I'll be out of here by July
Won't you kiss my kids on Christmas Day
Please don't let 'em cry for me

I guess the brothers are driving down
From Queensland and Stella's flying in from the coast
They say it's gonna be a hundred degrees
Even more maybe, but that won't stop the roast

Who's gonna make the gravy now?
I bet it won't taste the same
Just add flour, salt, a little red wine
And don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce
For sweetness and that extra tang

And give my love to Angus and to Frank and Dolly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry I screwed up this time
And look after Rita, I'll be thinking of her
Early Christmas morning
When I'm standing in line

I hear Mary's got a new boyfriend, I hope he can hold his own
Do you remember the last one? What was his name again?
(Just a little too much cologne)
And Roger, you know I'm even gonna miss Roger
'Cause there's sure as hell no one in here I want to fight

Oh praise the Baby Jesus, have a Merry Christmas
I'm really gonna miss it, all the treasure and the trash
And later in the evening, I can just imagine
You'll put on junior Murvin and push the tables back
And you'll dance with Rita, I know you really like her

Just don't hold her too close
Oh brother please don't stab me in the back
I didn't mean to say that, it's just my mind it plays up
Multiplies each matter, turns imagination into fact
You know I love her badly, she's the one to save me

I'm gonna make some gravy, I'm gonna taste the fat
Tell her that I'm sorry, yeah I love her badly
Tell 'em all I'm sorry
And kiss the sleepy children for me
You know one of these days, I'll be making gravy
I'll be making plenty, I'm gonna pay 'em all back

It's a beautiful mornin', ahhh
I think I'll go outside a while
And jus' smile
Just take in some clean fresh air, boy
Ain't no sense in stayin' inside
If the weather's fine an' you got the time
It's your chance to wake up and plan another brand new day
Either way
It's a beautiful mornin', ahhh
Each bird keeps singin' his own song
So long
I've got to be on my way, now
Ain't no fun just hangin' around
I've got to cover ground, you couldn't keep me down
It just ain't no good if the sun shines
When you're still inside
Shouldn't hide, still inside, shouldn't hide
Ahhhh oh! (shouldn't hide) ah ah oh

(Do do waaa, do do waaa)

There will be children with robins and flowers
Sunshine caresses each new waking hour
Seems to me that the people keep seeing
More and more each day, gotta say, lead the way
It's okay, wednesday, thursday, it's okay
(Ahhh) monday, wednesday, friday, weekday, ah ah ohhh

Ah ah oh oh (do do aaaa)
Wooooo oo oo oh oh oh ah wo do waa

LYRICS:
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me is what I hoped to be
I treated you unkindly, but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets of a true love
With holding nothing you came out in front when I was hiding
Now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody, 'cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you

I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing this song to you

We were alone and I was singing this song to you

I touch your body to let you know that the time is now
I want to love you like you never been loved baby
So make it rain silk on me

It will be me and you together
Rollin' in the bed, hiding in the, the covers
Loving each other for life, babe
Loving each other for life

Rollin in the bed, hiding in the the covers
Loving each other for life, babe
Loving each other for life

Loving you, is constantly up on my mind
Toe to toe
With your body on top of mine
Soaking wet

That's the way I like it, baby
So don't forget the towels
As you step into my room
Step into my room

It will be me and you together
Rollin' in the bed, hiding in the, the covers
Loving each other for life, babe

It will be me and you together
Rollin' in the bed, hiding in the, the covers
Loving each other for life, babe

Break it down baby, break it down
Said I like it baby
That's the way it's gonna be
Me and you, one on one

In my bedroom
Toe to toe

Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

I just saw her yesterday
I just saw her, asked her to stay
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?

Her and Bobby were steppin' out
Her and Bobby didn't know I found out
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know, know what I mean?

So I asked her if she still cared
She didn't hear me, she just stared
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?

And then she said
Lee you haven't loved me in nearly four years
You haven't noticed that I held back my tears
And now you have but it's really too late

Better find yourself another girl
Better find another girl
Better find uh, another place

She just left me yesterday
She just left me, had nothing to say
Do you know what I mean?
Oh, do you know what I mean?

She's a dandy, yes indeed
She's a dandy but now she's free
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean, yeah?

Been forty days since I don't know when
I just saw her with my best friend
Do you know what I mean?
Lord, do you know what I mean?

You can go down your list of trouble
And be on your merry way

'Coz I found the love I need a long time
I found the love to ease my troubled mind

Love, blind, hanging over my head
All of this time so it won't rain on me
He's my sunshine and your loving me
Gonna set me free, yeah

Mmm, sadness, I have no more use for you
I know you can leave me by, you were nothing for years

When I was kissing someone new deep inside I was missing you

Oh baby, you make me fall in love with you
Now I don't know just what I'm gonna do
Oh honey, I looked out into empty space
And all I saw was your sweet face

Love, love, love

LYRICS:
You say love is just a word, just four letters in a row
Just a thing that people say or they never tell you so
And you use every excuse to let nobody in
Now this cloud you bring around has become your only friend

And everybody saying that it's going to go away but it don't go
And everybody's telling you one day it's going to change
But you don't know if it's really going to end

But there is a way, there is a spark
There is a hope that you can hold on to
There is a lifeline come to the rescue
Just like a hand that's waiting for you
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone
There is a way, the truth and the life, and the way

But if love became a man if the word had flesh and bone
Would you recognize His face if He came to bring you home?
You think you're all alone, gotta do it on your own riding solo
Is there someone you can call when you stumble and fall?
'Cause you don't know if you'll be getting up again

There is a way, there is a spark
There is a hope that you can hold on to
There is a lifeline come to the rescue
Just like a hand that's waiting for you
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone
There is a way, the truth and the life, and the way

Don't you think your life's worth saving?
Don't you know that love's amazing?
Don't you want to lay your troubles down?
Lay them down

If I thought love was just a word, I might feel the same way too
But there's so much more than that and it's waiting here for you

There is a way, there is a spark
There is a hope that you can hold on to
There is a lifeline come to the rescue
Just like a hand that's waiting for you
And if you believe in this I promise that you won't be alone

There is a way, there is a way, there is a way
(Truth and the life and the way)
Come on, there is a way
(Truth and the life and the way)
There is a way, there is a way

Ooh, there is a way back home

Lido missed the boat that day he left the shack
But that was all he missed and he ain't comin' back
At a tombstone bar in a jukejoint car he made a stop
Just long enough to grab a handle off the top

Next stop, Chi-town, Lido put the money down, let it roll
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it, one for the road"

Lido, oh, oh, oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a waitin' for the go

Lido, oh, oh, oh
He said, "One more job oughta get it
One last shot 'fore we quit it, one more for the road"

Lido be runnin' havin' great big fun
Until he got the note
Sayin', "Tow the line or blow it"
And that was all she wrote

He be makin' like a beeline headin' for the borderline, goin' for broke
Sayin', "One more hit oughta do it
This joint ain't nothin' to it, one more for the road"

Lido, oh, oh, oh
He's for the money, he's for the show
Lido's a waitin' for the go

And honey, yes, I'd like to spend it all on you

Love, look what you've done to me
Never thought I'd fall again so easily
Oh, love, you wouldn't lie to me
Leading me to feel this way

They might fade and turn to stone
Let's get crazy all alone
Hold me closer than you'd ever dare
Close your eyes and I'll be there

After all is said and done
After all you are the one
Take me up your stairs and through the door
Take me where we don't care anymore

Yes, I'm good, good loving
With plenty, plenty hugging
Ooh, you cute little thang, you

Girl, between you and me, nah-nah
We don't need no company
No other man, no other girl
Can enter into our world

Not as long as you groove me, baby
Ahh, come on make me feel good inside
Come on and groove me, baby
Move me, baby

Ahh, sock it to me, mama
Uhh, ahh, I like it like that, baby
Uhh, groove me, baby, hey, uhh
Groove me, darling, come on, come on

I need you to sock it to me, mama
Come on and groove me, baby
Hey, uhh, good, God
It makes me feel so good inside, mama

Now, come on, come on and uhh
Groove me, baby, groove me, baby
Ahh, sock it to me, sock it to me
Rock it to me, come on, come on
Come on and uhh

Groove me, mama
I want you

LYRICS:
Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better, this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together, this Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me

Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you, this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town they do this Christmas

Fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me, yeah

Shake a hand, shake a hand now

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me, yeah

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm gonna get to know you better, this Christmas
And as we trim the tree
How much fun it's gonna be together, this Christmas

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas will be
Very special Christmas for me

Merry Christmas
Shake a hand, shake a hand now
Wish your brother Merry Christmas
All over the land now, yeah

Merry Christmas
