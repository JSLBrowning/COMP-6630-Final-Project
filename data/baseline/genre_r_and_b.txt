Sincerely Yours
How Do You Heal A Broken Heart
I can't believe what i just heard
Could it be true
Are you the girl I thought I knew
The one who promised me her love
Where did it go
Does anybody ever know

Chorus:
How do you heal a broken heart
That feels like it will never beat this much again
Oh no
I just can't let go
How do you heal a broken heart
That feels like it will never love this much again
Oh no
Tonight I'll hold what could be right
Tomorrow I'll pretend to let you go

And were you ever what you seemed
Or was I a fool who fell in love
With his own dream
And now you say you want to leave
Start a new life today
Those words I thought you'd never say

Chorus:
Tonight I'll hold what could be right
Tomorrow I'll pretend to
Wake and put it all behind me
And find that I have finally found

A new life
In my soul
And find that I know how to let you go
You go

Chorus:
Tonight I'll hold what could be right
Tomorrow i'll pretend to
Wake and put it all behind me
And find that I know how to let you go

LYRICS:
As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now
I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun
After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song, I look to you

About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left
Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to you
I look to you
And when all my strength is gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song, I look to you

My levee's have broken, my walls have come
Crumbling down on me
The rain is falling, defeat is calling
I need you to set me free

Take me far away from the battle
I need you, shine on me

I look to you
I look to you
After all my strength has gone
In you I can be strong

I look to you
I look to you
And when melodies are gone
In you I hear a song, I look to you

I look to you
I look to you

LYRICS:
[1st Verse]
She Was More Like A Beauty Queen From A Movie Scene
I Said Don't Mind, But What Do You Mean I Am The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round
She Said I Am The One Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

[2nd Verse]
She Told Me Her Name Was Billie Jean, As She Caused A Scene
Then Every Head Turned With Eyes That Dreamed Of Being The One
Who Will Dance On The Floor In The Round

[Bridge]
People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
And Mother Always Told Me Be Careful Of Who You Love
And Be Careful Of What You Do 'Cause The Lie Becomes The Truth

[Chorus]
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son

[3rd Verse]
For Forty Days And Forty Nights
The Law was on her Side
But Who Can Stand When She's In Demand
Her Schemes And Plans
'Cause We Danced On The Floor In The Round
So Take My Strong Advice, Just Remember To Always Think Twice
Do think Twice

[4th Verse]
She Told My Baby We'd Danced 'Till Three
Then She Looked At Me
She Showed A Photo Of A Baby Crying
His Eyes Looked Like Mine
Go On Dance On The Floor In The Round, Baby

[Bridge]
People Always Told Me Be Careful Of What You Do
And Don't Go Around Breaking Young Girls' Hearts
She Came And Stood Right By Me
Then The Smell Of Sweet Perfume
This Happened Much Too Soon
She Called Me To Her Room

[Chorus]
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
Billie Jean Is Not My Lover
She's Just A Girl Who Claims That I Am The One
But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, But The Kid Is Not My Son
She Says I Am The One, She Says He Is My Son
She Says I Am The One

LYRICS:
I took my baby
On a Saturday Bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

They print my message
In the 'Saturday Sun'
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
An' it's true
Either you're wrong
Or you're right

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

Don't depend

I am tired of this Devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Goin' when they going to gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the light get duller
I'm not going to spend
My life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you
Kicking dirt in my eye

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of bein' my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

No, no, alright
Alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright, alright
Jump on, don't
Yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white

LYRICS:
It's your birthday, so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip on weezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good but I know you want to cry out

You say you want passion and I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switchin' positions, you feel so rounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl?

Girl you know I, girl you know I, I been feenin'
Wake up in the late night, been dreamin' about your lovin'
Girl you know I, girl you know I

Deep until I know I pleased that body, body
Or girl, without a broom I might just sweep you off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody, body how I do

Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed
You close your eyes as I improv between your legs

LYRICS:
I stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself?
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no, no

Don't lose it all in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart

Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold, yeah
The more I try the less it's working, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no

Don't lose it all in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart

But tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are

Yes, no's, egos, fake shows like boom
Just go and leave me alone
Real talk, real life, good luck, good night
With a smile, that's my home, that's my home, no
No, no, no, no, no

Don't lose it all in the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart

Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Yeah, yeah, yeah

ARTIST: Stevie Wonder
LYRICS:
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
(Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
(Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
To last through forever and another day

Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always

As today I know I'm living but tommorow
Could make me the past but that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Did you know you're loved by somebody?)


Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
(Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
(I'll be lovin' you forever)
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
(Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you
(Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed


So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truths and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell

(I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
(Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
(Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
(Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

(Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
(Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more
(Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left

(I'll be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
(Be loving you)
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
(Be loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you
(Now ain't I loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

(Ain't I loving you?)
Until the ocean severs every mountain high
(I've got to say always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
(Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

(Always)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
(Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
(Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the days that are no more
(Always)
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself

(Always)
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself
Until dear mother nature says her work is through
Until the day that you are me and I am you

Heal The World
spoken:
Think about the generations and to say we want to make it a better
world for our children and our children's children. So that they know
it's a better world for them; and think if they can make it a better
place.


There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow.
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space, make a better place.

Chorus:
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for
You and for me.


If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving.
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world, make a better world.

Chorus:
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race.
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for
You and for me.

Bridge:
And the dream we would conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth, crucify it's soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be God's glow.


We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn
Their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space to make a better place.

Chorus:
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for
You and for me.

Refrain (2x)


There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me.
There are people dying if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me.

You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Make a better place
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children
You and for me / Heal the world we live in
You and for me / Save it for our children

LYRICS:
Girl I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase

Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day

I know I misbehave
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow

And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
â€~Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow

This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day

Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way

I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away

As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
â€~Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return

Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know, baby you and I

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah hey
â€~Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey hey

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
â€~Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow

Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow

Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow

This time we'll take it slow

They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it

Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it

You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby

Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love him

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby

Remember those walls I built
Well, baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make up a sound

I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo
I can feel your halo halo halo
I can see your halo halo halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again

Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face

LYRICS:
Na na na, come on
Na na na, come on
Na na na na na, come on
Na na na, come on, come on, come on

Na na na, come on
Na na na, come on
Na na na na na, come on
Na na na, come on, come on, come on

Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Part of the pain is the pleasure
'Cause nothing could measure

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
Seen the picture
Now the feeling leaves me wanting more

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
There's sex in the air I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
There's sex in the air I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na, come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Now come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it

Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
Seen the picture
Now the feeling leaves me wanting more

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
There's sex in the air I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na, come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Now come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it

S S S and M M M
S S S and M M M

Oh I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong

And meet me in my boudoir
With my body sayin' ah, ah, ah, I like it, like it

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
There's sex in the air I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

'Cause I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it
There's sex in the air I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Na na na, come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Now come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on, I like it, like it

LYRICS:
What you want, baby, I got
What you need, do you know I got it?
All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect when you come home


  (Just a little bit)
Hey baby
  (Just a little bit)
When you get home
  (Just a little bit)
Mister
  (Just a little bit)

I ain't gonna do you wrong while you're gone
Ain't gonna do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna
All I'm askin'
Is for a little respect when you come home

  (Just a little bit)
Baby
  (Just a little bit)
When you get home
  (Just a little bit)
Yeah
  (Just a little bit)

I'm about to give you all of my money
And all I'm askin' in return, honey
Is to give me my profits
When you get home

  (Just a, just a, just a, just a)
Yeah baby
  (Just a, just a, just a, just a)
When you get home
  (Just a little bit)
Yeah
  (Just a little bit)

Ooh, your kisses, sweeter than honey
And guess what? So is my money
All I want you to do for me
Is give it to me when you get home

  (Re, re, re ,re)
Yeah baby
  (Re, re, re ,re)
Whip it to me
  (Respect, just a little bit)
When you get home, now
  (Just a little bit)

R E S P E C T
Find out what it means to me
R E S P E C T
Take care, T.C.B.

Oh

  (Sock it to me, sock it to me)
A little respect
  (Sock it to me, sock it to me)
  (Sock it to me, sock it to me)
Whoa, babe

  (Just a little bit)
A little respect
  (Just a little bit)
I get tired
  (Just a little bit)
Keep on tryin'
  (Just a little bit)
You're runnin' out of foolin'
  (Just a little bit)
And I ain't lyin'
  (Just a little bit)

  (Re, re, re, re)
Respect
When you come home
  (Re, re, re, re)
Or you might walk in
  (Respect, just a little bit)
And find out I'm gone
  (Just a little bit)

LYRICS:
[Verse 1:]
If I could write you a song*
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used up all of my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

[[Verse 2:]
You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
It's probably cause, you think you're cooler than me.

You got your high brow,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around,
Like they ain't shit.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise.

[Verse 3:]
Shh, I got you,
All figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Behind your make up
Nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

[1]

[2]

You got your high brow,
Switch in your walk.
And you don’t even look,
When you pass by.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps
Make
That
Much
Noise.

[3]

Cause it sure seems.
Cause it sure seems
You got no doubt
That you got no doubt.
But we all seem
We all seem
We got your head
In the clouds

ARTIST: Alicia Keys
LYRICS:
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright

And no one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's gonna be alright

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is
Everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide something so real
So till the end of time, I'm telling you that in the world

No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

ARTIST: Beyonce Knowles
LYRICS:
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but can't complete
Listen to the sound from deep within
It's only beginning to find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

You should have listened, there is someone here inside
Someone I thought had died so long ago
Oh, I'm screaming out and my dreams'll be heard
They will not be pushed aside on words
Into your own all 'cause you won't
Listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on mind
You should have known

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't, if you won't

Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start but I will complete

Oh, now I'm done believing you
You don't know what I'm feeling
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you think you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own, my own

LYRICS:
Shady, Konvict, Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady
I see the one, 'cause she be that lady, hey!

I feel you creeping, I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the â€~lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club, the wardobe intact now

I feel it, don and crack now
Ooh I see it, don't let back now
I'ma call her then I put the mack down
Money? No problem, pocket full of that now

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Oh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil' drink on
They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it

Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls
Trying to hold my woodie back through my drawers

Steps upstage, didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, and she's like, "You're..."
I'm like, "I know, let's cut to the chase
No time to waste, back to my place"

Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace, shall I say
And plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing
Akon!

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Eminem's rollin', D an' â€~em rollin'
Boo and ol' Marvelous an' them rollin'
Women just hoein', big booty rollin'
Soon I be all in 'em an' throwin' D

Hittin' no less than three
Block wheel style, like whee
Girl I can tell you want me 'cause lately

I feel you creeping, I can see it from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over, look back and watch me

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh

Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, 'til you get sore
Smack that, oh ooh
TITLE: Smack That Lyrics
ARTIST: Kenny Lattimore
LYRICS:
For you I'd give a lifetime of stablility
Anything you want of me
Nothing is impossible
For you there are no words or ways to show my love
Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of

'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one I've made a change
And everything I do now makes sense
All roads end, all I do is for you

For you I share the cup of love that overflows
And anyone who knows us knows
That I would change all thoughts I have
For you there is no low or high or in between
Of my heart that you haven't seen

'Cause I share all I have and am
Nothing I've said is hard to understand
And all I feel I feel deeper still
And always will, all this love is for you

Every note that I play
Every word I might say
Every melody I feel
Are only for you and your appeal

Every page that I write
Everyday of my life
Would not be filled without the things
That my love for you now brings

For you I make a promise of fidelity
Now and for eternity
No one could replace this vow
For you I'd take your hand and heart and everything
And add to them a wedding ring

'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one you're all I know
If this feeling should leave I'd die
And here's why, all I am is for you

Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end and all I do, is for you
Only for you
