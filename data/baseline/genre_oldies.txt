THE CANDY MAN
Sammy Davis Jr.
(Leslie Bricusse / Anthony Newley)
- from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"
- as recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. with the Mike Curb Congregation

Who can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew
Cover it with choc'late and a miracle or two
The Candy Man, oh the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good

Who can take a rainbow, wrap it in a sigh
Soak it in the sun and make a groovy lemon pie
The Candy Man, the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good

The Candy Man makes everything he bakes satisfying and delicious
Now you talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes

Oh, who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream
The Candy Man, oh the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good

The Candy Man makes everything he bakes satisfying and delicious
Talk about your childhood wishes, you can even eat the dishes

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Who can take tomorrow, dip it in a dream
Separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream
The Candy Man, the Candy Man can
The Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
Yes, the Candy Man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good

Keep Me Hanging On
Keep Me Hanging On
Set me free, why don't you babe?
get out my life, why don't you babe?
'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hanging on

Set me free, why don't you babe?
get out my life, why don't you babe?
'cause you don't really need me
but you keep me hanging on

Why do you keep a-comin' around
playing with my heart
why don't you get out of my life
and let me make a brand new start
let me get over you
the way you've gotten over me, yeah

Set me free, why don't you babe?
get out my life, why don't you babe?
'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hanging on
now you don't really need me
you just keep me hanging on

You say although we broke
you still just wanna be friends
but how can we still be friends
when seeing you only breaks my heart again
and there ain't nothing I can do about it...

Get out, get out of my life
and let me sleep at night
'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hanging on

You say you still care for me
but your heart and soul needs to be free
now that you've got your freedom
you wanna still hold on to me
you don't want me for yourself
so let me find somebody else

Why don't you be a man about it and set me free
now you don't care a thing about me
you're just using me
get out, get out of my life
and let me sleep at night
'cause you don't really love me
you just keep me hanging on

'Cause you don't really need me
you just keep me hanging on

Mr. Custer
(That famous day in history the men of the 7th Cavalry went riding on)
(And from the rear a voice was heard)
(A brave you man with a trembling word rang loud and clear)
What am I doin' here??

Please Mr. Custer, I don't wanna go
Hey, Mr. Custer, please don't make me go
I had a dream last night about the comin' fight
Somebody yelled "attack!"
And there I stood with a arrow in my back.

Please Mr. Custer, I don't wanna go (forward Ho!!)--aaww

SPOKEN: Look at them bushes out there
They're moving and there's a injun behind every one
Hey, Mr. Custer-you mind if I be excused the rest of the afternoon?
HEY CHARLIE, DUCK YER HEAD!! 
Hmm, you're a little bit late on that one, Charlie
Hooh, I bet that smarts!

(They were sure of victory, the men of the 7th Cavalry, as they rode on)

(But then from the rear a voice was heard)
(That same brave voice with the trembling word rang loud and clear)
What am I doin' here??

Please Mr. Custer, I don't wanna go
Listen, Mr. Custer, please don't make me go
There's a redskin a'waitin' out there, just fixin to take my hair
A coward I've been called cuz I don't wanna wind up dead or bald

Please Mr. Custer, I don't wanna go (forward HO)--aaww

SPOKEN: I wonder what the injun word for friend is
Let's see-friend-- kemo sabe, that's it
KEMO SABE!, HEY OUT THERE-KEMO SABE! 
Nope, that itn't it
Look at them durned injuns
They're runnin' around like a bunch of wild Indians-heh, heh, heh
Nah, this ain't no time for jokin'

TITLE: Islands In The Stream (Duet With Kenny Rogers) Lyrics
LYRICS:
Baby, when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside, there was something going on

You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart, we got something going on

Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear this could be the year for the real thing

No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Sail away, love come sail away with me

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh

Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong

TITLE: Farewell Lyrics
LYRICS:
We used to be frightened and scared to try
Of things we don't really understand why
We laugh for a moment and start to cry
We were crazy

Now that the end is already here
We reminisce 'bout old yells and cheers
Even if our last hurrahs were never clear

Farewell to you my friends
We'll see each other again
Don't cry 'cause it's not the end of everything
I may be miles away
But here is where my heart will stay
With you, my friends with you

Yesterday's a treasure, today is here
Tomorrows' on its way, the sky is clear
Thank you for the mem'ries of all the laughters and tears
And not to mention our doubts and our fears
The hypertension we gave to our peers
It's really funny to look back after all of these years

Farewell to you my friends
We'll see each other again
Don't cry 'cause it's not the end of everything
I may be miles away
But here is where my heart will stay
With you, my friends with you

Farewell to you my friends
We'll see each other again
Don't cry 'cause it's not the end of everything
I may be miles away
But here is where my heart will stay
With you, my friends with you
With you, my friends with only you

Away from home through no wish of my own.

Letters, never a letter,
I get no letters in the mail.
I've been forgotten, yeah, forgotten,
Oh how I wonder how is it I failed.

LYRICS:
You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money

It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

And don't you know, don't you know
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own
But you can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong

'Cause you're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money

It's a bitch girl and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow?
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all

You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
And you can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money

It's a bitch girl and it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far
Say money but it won't get you too far
Get you too far

And you say, you can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
You're a rich girl, a rich girl
Oh, you're a rich, rich girl, yeah
Say money but it won't get you too far

What Kind Of Fool Am I
WHAT KIND OF FOOL AM I?
Sammy Davis, Jr.

What kind of fool am I
Who never fell in love
It seems that I'm the only one
that I have been thinking of

What kind of man is this?
An empty shell-
A lonely cell in which
an empty heart must dwell

What kind of lips are these
That lied with every kiss
That whispered empty words of love
that left me alone like this

Why can't I fall in love
Like any other man
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am.

What kind of clown am I?
What do I know of life?
Why can't I cast away the mask of play
and live my life?

Why can't I fall in love
Till I don't give a damn
And maybe then I'll know what kind of fool I am

Break My Stride
Last night I had the strangest dream
I sailed away to China, in a little rowboat to find ya
And you said you had to get your laundry clean
Didn't want no one to hold you, what does that mean? And you said...

{chorus}
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running in a one touch ground, oh no
I got to keep on moving

You're on the road and now you pray you'll last 
The road beyond was rocky
But now you're feeling cocky
You look at me and you see your past
Is that the reason why you're running so fast? And she said...

{chorus}

Never let another girl like you whip me over
Never let another girl like you drag me under
If I meet another girl like you I will tell her
Never want another girl like you have to say - oh!

Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
Nobody gonna slow me down, oh no
I got to keep on moving
Ain't nothing gonna break my stride
I'm running in a one touch ground, oh no
I got to keep on moving

Beggin', put your lovin' hand out, baby

I need you to understand
That I tried so hard to be a man
The kind of man you'd want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life is hangin' over me
Broken man that I don't know
Will leave it standing, devil's dancing with my soul

Beggin' you, won't you give your hand out, baby
Beggin' you, put your lovin' hand out, baby

I'm fightin' hard to hold my own
No, I just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
Now that big brass ring is a shade of black

Fighting soldiers from the sky 
Fearless men who jump and die 
Men who mean just what they say 
The brave men of the Green Beret 

Silver wings upon their chest 
These are men, America's best 
One hundred men will test today 
But only three win the Green Beret 

Trained to live off nature's land 
Trained in combat, hand-to-hand 
Men who fight by night and day 
Courage peak from the Green Berets 

Silver wings upon their chest 
These are men, America's best 
One hundred men will test today 
But only three win the Green Beret 

Back at home a young wife waits 
Her Green Beret has met his fate 
He has died for those oppressed 
Leaving her his last request 

Put silver wings on my son's chest 
Make him one of America's best 
He'll be a man they'll test one day 
Have him win the Green Beret.

When you walk into a room
You're beauty steals my breath away
When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say

Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should've never let you go

Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share
But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear

I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so
Why did I have to write this song
I should've never let you go

Why in all the wide wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear
I'll never understand, I'll never understand
Why I even give a damn

When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground
I built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down

You're the kind I can't forget
Let the tears begin to flow
I have only one regret
I should've never let you go

I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
I should've never let you go
