LYRICS:
Super ugly
Mr X to tha Z
Yeah, Warren
LA indo, gangster and mack mo
Bullets at your window, dangerous

Ruthless, hostile, unforgiven, who gave you permission
To try to stop me from livin', huh? Try again faggot
You've gotta ride better than that
To move out in front of the pack, it's two thousand and two

My backpack raps got my backpack
Strapped and filled with plaques
I ain't relaxed or laid back at home with my feet up
I drop Pravda, lock and load, heat the streets up
You weak fuck

Shakin' and dancin'
Y'all takin' pills, we takin' penitentiary chances
I'm too advanced is
Never the same when I hit it and quit it
You want it come get it, I'm wit' it

When I say that I'm wit' it
That means I got a main defense team that's gon' get me acquitted
G's is walkin' out the courtroom like George Jefferson
Stop the interviewin', the faggot had it comin' to him

Warren G

What y'all thought, I wasn't gonna return with a hit
Too much smokin' that Sherman shit
I learnt this from the best that got y'all sprung
The, the doctor Andre Young

Compton, LB, ain't nothing y'all can tell me
Goin' hard on the yard till my dogs bail me
They tells me I can't proceed wit' it
I came back and got Warren G wit' it

West coast, still smoking on that indo
Smoke, oh no, don't pretend, oh no
I woulda came but I was dead broke, no mo
I'm rollin' on some real, oh no

'Bout to get it, but niggas trip though, let's go
I'm the realest and they all know real dope
You need a filter or you will choke, indo
That's all a nigga will smoke, oh no

Now, niggas better get between their door, door
I'm shakin' all your shit onto the floor
And niggas don't get it
But be careful what you ask for you just might get it

Yo the undisputed middle weight champ runnin' like Hopkins
Clap six to ya shins niggas start hoppin', Shiest never stoppin'
In other words, if your click full
Can't press mute and it don't apply now

I'm feelin' funny in the tummy
And a nigga ain't been eatin' for weeks, I'm sick
I ain't trying to get no better but rather
Infect the world leavin' Vicks in a old sweater

Knoc's landin', tell me if it ain't me, who got the best planin'?
Who got your ears tuned it and who keeps you listenin'?
Who gots your undivided attention?
Who makes your panties wet, girl?

Hold up, pause, which nigga on TV
That you see makes you wanna give up the draws
At parties and shows, I mash regardless
Yo hardest flows couldn't stop this bombardment
I clench the vision till there's no room for expansion

All prepared for war it's Knoc's landin'
A nightly stalker, in shadows I walk
Mindin' my own while haters throw soft
The more I succeed, the more bitches clock

Through my peripheral vision, I watch subconsciously
Waitin' to introduce you to tragedy see it's Knoc's landin'

You ready?
Yes
Yeah, yeah
[Incomprehensible], I like singing

My music, my life, my heart, my soul
My music, my everything, I give my all
My wife, my daughter, my love, my dream
My mother, my father, my brother, my team

My camp, my squad, my house, my car
My boat, my shoes, my pants, my shirt
My coke, my sugar, my cream, my butter
My toast, my all, my queen, my folks

My baby
Walk like six strings, talk like she's my everything
My baby
Loves me, hates me, leaves me, runs right, right

That sexy lady
All I know, she shed's all my confusion, so
My baby
Will not run from anything, I swear, this goes

Lord, will lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
And muzic should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take

She's thick, she's bad, so clean, she's fine
She loves, she hates, she laughs, she cries
She hurts, she lies, she's Bonnie, I'm Clyde
She's ghetto, she's real, she sings, she rhymes

She comes, she goes, she lives, she dies
She sexy and bomb, she blows my mind
She stays in line, she's smart, she's funny
She's crafty and cunning in the game she's running

Her lips, her back, her waist, her thighs
Her face, her skin, her hair, her eyes
Her voice, her shape, her hips, her mind
Her love, her smile, her touch, her time

My baby
Walk like six strings, talk like she's my everything
My baby
Loves me, hates me, leaves me, runs right, right

That sexy lady
All I know, she shed's all my confusion, so
My baby
Will not run from anything, I swear, this goes

I'm typsy, I'm through, I'm drunk, I'm blunted
My way, my day, my life, I love it
I move, I groove, I shake, I love it
My friends, my kins, I like, I love it

I show, I prove, I live, I learn
I show, I teach, I run these streets
My kin, my heart, my heat, my rhythm
My rap, my beat, my life, my head and my feet

My heart, my soul, my candy, my cake
My platinum, my gold, my land, my gate
My Benz, my lake, my keys, my money
My love, my hate

My clothes, my phone, my house, my home
My money, my comb, my sugar
My spice, my base, my chrome
My rhythm, my music, my home
My world, my girl, my life, my home

My baby
Walk like six strings, talk like she's my everything
My baby
Loves me, hates me, leaves me, runs right, right

That sexy lady
All I know, she shed's all my confusion, so
My baby
Will not run from anything, I swear, this goes

My baby
Walk like six strings, talk like she's my everything
My baby
Loves me, hates me, leaves me, runs right, right

LYRICS:
Mac flossy where you at?
(Aah)
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California
I wish they all could be California hoes

California bitches
(Tim dog)
Some bad hoes
Bitch you digging in the wrong dirt bitch
Ain't no gold in here
Fucking with the wrong niggas
Knoc-Turn'al, Slip Capone, Short Dog

I knew a tight white bitch named Marianna
She lived right around the corner from Temecula
See I was bored, I fucked both of them whores before
So I called my other bitch Elsinore

She wasn't cracking
So I called up Hesperia and Monrovia and Valencia
I got some pussy from Pomona and her sister Corona
It ain't nothing like them hoes in southern California

I knew a bitch named Irvine
She had a cousin with the name Santa Ana
It was short for Anaheim
I got high in Riverside with Receda and Rosarito
And Santa Clarita and [unverified]

I'm pleased to meet you
I've been all around the world
And with over a thousand girls
And homeboy I don't know what you have been told
But Eskimo pussy is mighty cold
(Brrr)

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

You might be gold
But lately I been doing the platinum pose
Knoc-Turn'al's on 128 girl
What? I'll be right over

Magazines choreograph me in photos
I put out with three dime pieces slamming four doors
And if I can use cities in relation to hoes
I probably fucked San Fernando's daughter, Santa Barbera

And her best friend Alameda and Sierra
And Ramona's little sister Covina
And I don't know what you thought
Whether you turned the cat in the night bitch

Still the only manipulation weapon you got
Knoc-Turn'al ain't the one to fall victim to your plots
Before I save a hoe from the block
Her great grandchildren's corpses will rot
Fuck a hoe

I'd rather have money and a multiple round spitting glock
Four mansions with multiple cars investing my chips in stock
Even if I can't spell dow jones I still pull out fat knocks
It don't stop

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

They say this is a man's world
Can't understand it girl
All you ever wanted was a man like Chante Moore
You know us ballers never have one woman

And when you need us we never come running
That's why now you think about your ex again
You want to page him just to have sex with him
But instead you better call your next of kin

And complain these ballers won't let you in
She don't love you she loves money and sex
Bitches shoot you in the head for a Rolex
I know the bitch is a dick fiend

I fucked her one night when she was sixteen
I know it seems like a long time ago
But I fucked her again when she was twenty four
Bitch, I'm an old school vet, they call me Too $hort

Look your woman in the eyes
What she do it for? Biyatch
You know these hoes man
They'd do anything if they think it's for the money, that's why

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses
All around the globe back to California
Everywhere I go they all up on us
These hoes, these hoes, these hoes
Got cash sniffin' noses

[Intro: Cold 187Um]
Aoowwwww, aoowwwwww, ha ha, aooww, aoww
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G from Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G from Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore

[PEE GEE]
Zoe and hoe, these guys, yo they can't chill
This is how they groove, as hell yeah
You can't be titanium
OOOOhh God, are you glad?

[Cold 187Um]
The definition of my status; I'm a G
Cause some of you wanna see me, and some of you wanna be me
You couldn't even break my sweat
Hollerin' 187 but they ain't killed shit yet
Yo, but I'm a player to the T
Aww yes, and I can take you back just like the cold jack memory
I got strikes, so guess I got many stripes
From checkin' a gang of niggaz, and landin' a gang of pipes
Whores know I do it good, those know I do it good
See, they don't try to test and I wish they would
Cause I ain't standin' out like those from the past
Cause if I'm goin' off the gangbang, I'm still quick to blast
So fuck the drive-by, I stepped out, and stepped up
And if we got beef, BOO, you're fucked
I got skills to pay my grandchildren's bills

[KM.G]
How you're livin' player?

[Cold 187Um]
Yo player, by bein' real
Cause I'm in time and time and time again
I've found myself in a green 2B
Gouge his eyes out, goin' for a long long ride
Aoowww, and it's like bobba dabbab bam bam battattam
Bam bam, bam bam, she said: ooooh wait a minute
But I was full of that Gin and Juice
So I'm all in ridin' that ass like a horse
Cause boom boom boom me a bad boy
Ugh, I wake them up, and I make them smilled the coffee
And when I'm finished up, umm, they want another cup
Cause it's good, good to the last drop
So baby get on your knees and do me like you did last summer
Ugh, I think I lost my memory
That was it you? - or was it Shierce?
Or was it because I'm Dell? - or was it because I'm Vivi?
Don't be surpriced cause I played you like that
Awww, Cause I'm a straight up man

[Chorus: Cold 187Um, Kokane & KM.G w/ minor variations]
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G from Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G and Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore

[KM.G]
G, I'm kind of weak when it comes to the tits, your nipples
Let me hit and pull your Chili dim pussy
I'm kind of owned the Smith & Wesson side of the industry
Is you fearin' me?
Claimin' straight Pimp Gang, blast when I'm on ahh..
Hit you on the backside, bounce on my 'tonas
Straight through your hood, I be on my way
With some Endo and a fifth of Alaz
[Cold 187Um] Cause ain't no Sunshine..
Yeah, it's kind of cloudy
Ask me why I pumped my nine, cause your hood is kind of rowdy
I'm out here sexin' on drunk
Plus, I got two and ounce chickens in my truck
Hold up, the nigga has pagered on
[Cold 187Um] Nigga, where are my shit at?
But I'm out here flexin' and it just don't quit
See, I'm kind of large and when it comes to my Johnson
I'm flossin, I'm sexin, I'm stabbin, perfection
Make a fleece, make a bomb ass fleece
Hittin' them Doggystyle, waddin' a gallon of V.S.O.P.
Saggin' as I be in their crib
Called the niggaz in the Clinic tell them just what I did

[Chorus: Cold 187Um, Kokane & KM.G w/ minor variations X2]
I took the G and the Gangster, I took the G and Gigolo
So when I roll on my window, I make sure I get at that whore

[PEE GEE]
Yeah, (Spanish word)
These guys, yo they can't chill
This is how they groove, as hell yeah
You can't be titanium
OOOOhh God, are you glad?

[Kokane]

es la sangre que nos une en un solo corazon
es la fuerza de el amor
es la magia que funde en un abrazo de los dos

Si tropiezo al caminar
mis pabres son la luz
dan a mi quien cofiar
no se cansan de luchar de darme lo mejor
hoy doy gracias a los dos
son mi fe y ellos son mi guia y nunca me fallaran y por mi darian mi vida sin pensar

Now listen girl yous my mothafuckin' homie

Girl I got a suggestion
Hop ya ass in the car
And don't ask me no questions
Ay yo, driver pay attention
What you lookin' in the rear view for huh, Benson

I shoulda pulled out the Bentley Coupe
The GT seats look like Campbell Soup
Mmm, mmm, good you so lovely
You say you from the hood
You sayin' Dre thug me

You want it wit ya iPod on
So you can get hip to all my songs
And we can do it to the beat
It goes boom boom boom boom skeet

Now hoe you like that ma?
The way she screamin' had me thinking

It's a cool and Dre production and a epidemic

And do tricks on a pole sit in ya lap and speak to ya
Pay attention this a motion feature
Starrin' me and the butt naked slim bo-legged Skeeza

She goin' downtown like SWV, um

Think Monica Louinski, Paris and Moesha
Head in the hotel sippin' brandy smokin' reefa

And I'm so high ya boi don't lie
That's my homie crack's phantom, I don't own that ride
But I got some black Trojans and it goes quite nice
And what's under ya underneath, ya la perla, I can go all night

LYRICS:
This is a warning, another cut to move on
Another beat that's so strong
Hold on and I get wicked in this song
Stir up shit as the wit gets wisdom

P-Dog comin' up, I'm staying low
Pro-black and it ain't no joke
Comin' straight from the mod that broke shit last time
Now I'm back with a brand new sick rhyme

So black check time and tempo
Revolution ain't never been simple
Following the path from Allah for know just
Build your brain and we'll soon make progress

Paid your dues, don't snooze or lose
That came with the master plan that got you
So know who's opposed to the dominant dark skin
Food for thought as a law for the brother man

P-Dog with a gift from heaven
Tempo 116.7
Keeps you locked in time with the program
When I get wild I pile on dope jams

They spit on your flag and government
â€~Cause help the black was a concept never meant
Nigger please, food stamps and free cheese
Can't be the cure for a sick disease

Just the way the devil had planned it
Rape then pillage everyone on the planet
Then give 'em fake gods at odds with Allah
Love thy enemy and all that hooplah

Hear close to the words I wrote
Crack, cocaine are genocide on black folks
Cool when I write mine, never coulda missed this
Damn right when you think seditious

And I move swiftly, you can't get with me
The triple six moved quick but missed me
When I came off involved in conscience
So don't ask why next time I start this

Now let's get wild, allow me to freestyle
I build and fill your mind up with know-how
Common sense, a defense to next time
A pig tried to step to this, listen

Never let someone work on ya
They don't belong 'til they set you from
Ya can't be intrigued by the leads a pig lead
Unless you don't give a fuck to be free

Keep stompin' on, keep stompin'
Attitude but I ain't from Compton
I can't be fucked around or muffed around
I can't be held down, check the sound

And keep in tuned on point on target
The revolution won't be thwarted
A set back, â€~cause my man it's plain to see
Lost in a white supremacy

So let the rhythm roll on while I kick this
Brothers gonna work it out, with a quickness
And now you know just why a panther went crazy
The devil made me

Now, I'm listening you communists, niggaz and jews
Tell all your bodies to spread the news
Cause their judgement will soon been alight
As the lord in this wisdom looks down from height
Well, it's better be lost my mixing the races
We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown faces
Never, never, never, never, I say
Cause the Ku Klucks Klan is here to say:
Never, never, never, never, I say
Cause the Ku Klucks Klan is here to say:
Here's two clunches are bitter with lynches in their lyrics

They're handin' out the murder raps
Yeah, they're shakin' suckers like craps
Shit comes to pass, nigga
I hope you're not the victim of a raper
And let a nigga take your paper
And run, and live life swell
While you're rottin' and rhymin' in a cell
Now break yourself, nigga, how the hell you figure?
You used to need gas money home
Yeah, I guess the Gs are full grown

[Cold 187Um:]
Yeah, now it's time to play, the motherfuckin' clone

[KM.G:]
You're actin' all stupid like you don't know where we been
We buyin' a gang of gats, so tell a friend "Tell them"
That God put us here, to innovate first
Now the world's given, uncle Sam's Curse

[Cold 187Um:]
See, I don't trust man, nigga, only trust God
So when it's on, bow down to the Black Mob
I be the dark skinny nigga representin' from Pomona
In the Rag-Top-Trey, on them dark corners
Yeah, cause I'm a floss for mine, and I'm a toss for mine
To let you know, that it costs for mine
Yeah, cause I'm a come like a true nigga
And for lunch, I think I won't fly twice, nigga
Awww shit, aww shit, we're goin' off the deep end
We're all off the hook and we're flowin' like the wind
I'm a take off on your ass like a LearJet
And if the shit gets deep, you gonna get wet up
And out of the luck, tryin' to fuck with the original
I used to slang dope, but now I get residuals

What'chu know about them porch monkey raps and lies?
What'chu know about the image black men as pimps?
And Slavor Slav-ass country coon niggaz with limp?
What you know about a mack MC with skills
who could spit and kick real shit people could feel?
What'chu know about the radio and fake-ass clowns
with the same ten songs, every city and town?
What'chu know about that Hollywood culture fetish
and who fuckin who and what bitches is wearin?
And who gettin fat and who adoptin who
And what nigga got arrested now actin a fool
What'chu know about these rappers on Cribs at night?
Shootin pool with no motherfuckin books in sight
Grinnin grills when they showin off they rims and ice
With that 'HAA', wish them dumb motherfuckers be quiet!
See I'm fresh outta favors so excuse my tone
This bullshit been goin on way too long
Who decide what'chu listen to and what gets shown?
Who decides what message get inside your home?
I'm knowin all about devil-ass Jimmy Iovine
And all of the rest of the killin machine
Debra Lee and the BET hoes and demons
Dealin dope through the radio and video screens
I'm sayin... what if we demand a change?
And blow heads off 'stead of complainin
I'll bet then you listen what folks sayin
When we say we had enough, knowin we ain't playin
Now get fired up

[Chorus]
I get fired up (*3X*)
Look at what they doin to me
I get fired up (*3X*)
Look at what they doin to me

[Paris]
Oh yeah~! And fuck these political hacks
Wanna act like they the mouthpiece for blacks
Jesse Lee and Ward Connerly and Keyes attack
anything black when white folks writing the checks
And in fact, I could see hella niggaz is blind
Like Armstrong leavin every child behind
And McWhorter's a whore too, shit is a crime
Clarence Thomas couldn't ever be a brother of mine
I shine light on that bullshit, it's all self hate (yeah)
Who the next face to betray the race?
I place bets that the real people sure to relate
When I blast on that bootlickin masquerade, and say
Hold up, wait a minute, nigga stop please
Me don't suffer from vic-tim mentality
All we ever did was want to try to get a piece
of the pie that supposedly for everybody
Real talk, somebody best tell Russell
Fo' street niggas catch his ass up in a tussle
Drop squad in effect man, deprogram
We throw his pink wearing ass in the back of the van
And say no more rap apologist, I quit!
Every diamond is a blood diamond, please forgive
And see me redeemed for the deeds I did
For that Def Jam scam pushin poison to kids
Now get fired up

[Chorus]

[Paris]
What about these racists that talk that shit
'bout these immigrants, like they claim to it's legit?
Like they ain't stole it anyway, murdered and pillaged
Like they justified, cryin 'bout they want to get rid of
It's the 1-2-3, the 3 to 2-1 (yeah)
This nation was built on the backs of brown
slave trade and the dead red population
Put the yellow man in a camp concentration
Now - I blast on these right wing hoes
Now who'll be the first exposed?
Hannity with that weak doublespeak his tone
I'll make his drop out bartenderin ass get thrown
And fuck Mike Savage~! Radio snake
With that bully bullshit minuteman debate
Pro-life, pro-war, man it's all pro-hate
Do 'em in for his sins and Katrina disdain
And uhh... motherfuck yo' taxes bitch
While Chevron is stackin chips
While they send another off to die
Send another young body to Iraq with lies
What the fuck you gonna say to me? I see right through it
Through the smokescreen keepin folks meaner and stupid
Through the fake fear, fake tears, pride and collusion
Ain't no fakes here, all I see is lies and abuses
P (Dog), still the one you can't fuck with
Educated then a motherfucker, I see clearly
Can't be whupped or debated, can't break my spirit
Never bought off, never go soft, and never fear it
Hear it loud when I say it, that's the way that it go
Hear it loud, cause I'm killin 'em with words in a row
Bitch it ain't Paris Hilton, it's the murderous flow
Only P-Dog spittin is the Paris you know

TITLE: Get Fired Up Lyrics
ARTIST: Above the Law
LYRICS:
[Verse One: KMG]
See I wakes up in the afternoon
Somewhat kinda slow
I'm thinking about the homie he just got caught
He ain't never bang befo'
Yeah, it's '97 it's too late for that shit
I don't trip, I take a sip
And then I think I'm still drinking
Yeah the hood is leaking
All my little freaks is like creeping
Then I found out
All them niggas we put down was like bitches
Motherfucking snake ass bitches
See, never no mo' slipping
I'm still tripping how they say 'Pac gone
But I still hear them songs
I guess the real niggas feel it
And all the cowards around the world really didn't
(I know they didn't)
See I need's a new bag to bag big head Monopoly money
It ain't funny
A nigga need them bills to fold
When I roll, we in the industry we like hoes on a stroll
So I'ma stick a nigga fo' I go
See ah, my youngest daughter she like spoiled
So if I have to sell a gang of cavi and spread my soil
I'ma do this cause my nigga's rent due
Plus all that little shit that me and Kaos done been through
Plus collaborations from my nigga Hutch
He keep a nigga pocket broke huff
Ha
No no' swap meet, 10K
A nigga feel good on a stroll through Coitier (who wanna play?)
I still hang with my niggas that sell that shit
I tell you how much it cost and where to get it
ATL got clientele so you know that we gon' flip it
Riding wild in the west with a meal ticket

[Hook]
Sometimes I can't fight the feeling
These setbacks they come by the millions
Life is one big escapade
You won't know till it's too late
Sometimes I can't fight the feeling
These setbacks they come by the millions
Everyday's an episode
Can you handle the load?

[Verse Two: Cold 187um]
Now I was told to sit down and shut when grown folks speak
And keep your head in them books fuck them streets
But instead I be out here and with my next of kin
Trying to dodge doing 20 in the pen
So count me in
On the half of them two thangs
So I can paint a much brighter picture for my frame
And count change
My baby mama think that I'm a bank
She thinks my car is always on a full tank
Yeah, mama be telling me to slow down
Take a deep breath
And take a step and look around
Uh, yeah
Cause I don't think that I can grind forever
I got to trust who I can trust and put up with bad weather
I shake broads to the left
Cause I don't know who gon' try to gank me and shank me for my wealth
Yo, I learn from my great uncle Ken
That there's a thin line between you and your ends

LYRICS:
No me cuentes cuentos que no crees ni tu no me hagas malas cuentas que te pongo una cruz;
Yo no tengo paranoias ni una tabla de windsurf pero tengo las ideas mucho mas claras que tu;
Cuidame esta tierra que es la unica que tengo y no caces mas ballenas ni me ensucies mas el cielo;
una novia, un buen trabajo y un coche de Madrid toda la vida compitiendo y al final lo haras feliz

Cosas de mayores, un mundo al reves cabeza con pies;
cosas de mayores, no quiero aprender tanta estupidez.

Un millón de luces luego todos a bailar, no me derrito por los chicos yo nunca voy a fumar;
en mi casa hay una fiesta aunque se enfade papá me hago otro par de agujeros para dos piercings mas;
Ellos imponen sus reglas, nos controlan con reloj, y después nos dan ejemplo haciendo lo que dicen no;
está prohibido divertirse, hasta en el parque de atracciones, y molesto todo el día con las cosas de mayores!!!

Cosas de mayores un mundo al reves cabeza con pies;
cosas de mayores no quiero aprender tanta estupidez,(x2)

cosas de mayores puaaj

cosas de mayores

Cosas de mayores un mundo al reves cabeza con pies;
cosas de mayores no quiero aprender tanta estupidez.

ARTIST: Paris
LYRICS:
[Paris]
Hard truth soldier music, hard truth over music
Exposed so the youth can use it
Guerrilla Funk don't confuse it
With off-brand gangster rap that don't do shit
P-Dog and I'm back with a new clique
Sharpshooters, four deep in a 'lark shooters
That might creep in dark and shoot the police
in the heart for Sean Bell and Martin Luther
Cause ever since '90, America
Tried to bling me, but they still can't blind me
18 years behind me, 20 mo' left
Pro-left, pro-death, the "Bush Killa"
Corporate conservative crook killer
Wolfowitz for the chips that he took killer
This industry is full of shook niggaz
That's why the shame grip breaker returns to left hook niggaz

[Interlude]
Now when we say Guerrilla Funk, we don't mean monkeys on a vine
We mean this as in New Orleans, Virginia Tech and Columbine

[Paris]
We still rise like gas prices, on fire like
CNN satellite vans if they pass by us
Like Bechtel hush money cash stipends
Lindsay Lohan's nose and vagina
Fuck Imus, then again white folks pointin
fingers at the hate that hate made is timeless
Look at Hussein, paid 'em, trained 'em
Played 'em, called 'em Al Qaeda then hanged 'em
You said die nigga? But I'm still crackin
Like six out of twenty nine eleven highjackers
If anybody dead, it's kids in the black church
bein mislead by the misled
B-E-T, tellin kids get bread
But never tellin 'em what to do with bread
A project for the bitch scared
Joe Biden runnin blue but he just might drip red

[Chorus]
Now when we say Guerrilla Funk, we don't mean monkeys on a vine
We mean this as in New Orleans, Virginia Tech and Columbine
O.J. Simpson, B.T.K., Beltway, Peterson, Jon Benet
The San Francisco Panther 8, our government's hate for foreign kind

[Paris]
Representin for the innocent victims out in Darfur
But it's really not our war
I'ma leave it alone on this track cause that's somethin
I had to go and write to a whole 'nother song for
The rap shit got niggas on all fours
T-Kash make many sound like Forrest
Guerrilla Funk, straight vets, place bets them
Pseudo-ass revolutionaries never come towards us
By the way, if you ain't spittin hard truth
Then you ain't spittin shit up in our booth
Grande mocha civil rights leaders get a
blue star momma tryin to walk up in our shoes
GuerrillaFunk dot com is the website
Log on get'cha head right
We got pro red right scared to head to bed at night
Hard Truth won't spare ya life motherfucker

[Chorus]

[interlude from Malcolm X's "Black revolution requires bloodshed" speech]
What is a revolution?
Was no love lost, was no compromise, was no negotiation
I'm tellin you you don't know what a revolution is~!
because when you find out what it is you'll get out of the way
You haven't got a revolution that doesn't involve bloodshed
and you're afraid to bleed
I saw it, you're afraid to bleed
If it is right, for America to draft us
And teach us how to be violent
Then it is right for you and me

[singer - repeat 2X]
We don't talk about, we do it
Got no time to dance, it's the movement
Comin way too strong, let's move it
Freedom must be won, or lose it

[Paris - repeat 2X]
Who said freedom could ne-ver be won?
Who said it was the ballot or the gun?
Who said a group like us, couldn't move?
It wasn't me, but maybe it was you

ARTIST: Paris
LYRICS:
[Paris]
Yeah, yeah
I'm representin where the sun set
Guerrilla Funk and we still ain't done yet
T-K.A.S.H. and the "Bush Killa," one threat
One sniper on the rooftop, one vet
Now come get with this West coast revolutionary tag team
Republican bad dream, blitzin the rap scene
Pullin over five-oh, profilin white folks
Rewirin Diebolds, why you lie under oath
I'ma let the fo' pancake, drag and scrape
Drive by the county jail with a hand grenade
It's a planned escape, Tommy Kash take the wheel
as I throw it at the gate for the Panther 8

[T-K.A.S.H.]
While you sucker butts trippin off job cuts, I just
keep a glock tucked for the FBI
Like a Walter Reed patient they'll let me die
for my deadly vibe, but instead we ride

[Chorus]
Real revolution, actual solution
You can clap if you want but it ain't 'bout that
Hard Truth the movement, more than just music
The respect of the ghetto is where it's at

[Parise]
See we make the hood mobilize
Rise up cause they 'posed to rise, ride on you cause they 'posed to ride
For the Hard Truth Soldier side
When you see this motorcade unload and drive

[T-K.A.S.H.]
Come slow from behind
And let the automatic make a hole from behind
The rich stay panicked, but the po' don't mind
If piggies get blasted, just those hasslin brown and black kids

[Paris]
We some West coast classics, left vote passing
No wackness, no braggin, so active
Freedom and equality we gon' have it
Known assassins known for blastin Dog and K.A.S.H.

[T-K.A.S.H.]
On and crackin', fo'-fo's and masks
For po-po's harrassin po' folks with passion
Hard truth soldiers, our troops home right now
or the nine millimeter might BLAOW~!

[Chorus]

[T-K.A.S.H.]
The hood know my name, I'm good with the game
If Cheney got shot then I would get the blame
even though I didn't do it, the feds can't stand to see
a revolutionary with the ghetto influence
By the way I talk turf, and still spit the real
on the way they got work, for kids in the hills
But they only got purp, and pills where it is
Mo' liquor stores than church, the dead folks go on shirts
I'm T-K.A.S.H., the pride of the underground
Guerrilla Funk, never ride to another sound
Make a politician run and hide when they come around
cause of how I instruct hounds to gun ya down
The government make scratch mo'
than my homegirl who be spinnin for my potnah with the afro
Black folks stack dough, scratch the smoke
Subtract dope, add hope and vote, like that doe!

Whatchu want?
Whatchu want?
Get off me

I pull quick, it's useless, I'm fully clipped, 6 fo' fully dipped
Throw chrome whip with three freaks and full hips with firm tits
Yeah, we fully chipped, been on gangsta shit
It's ruthless, drunk off two fifths

Who make hits? Who we wit?
Westcoast parties don't stop
Who drop head-boppers?
The head doctor, bed-rocker

Police pursue me in squad cars and helicopters
Checkin' lockers, Mexican connect to play soccer
PH's and cockblockers
Ho-hoppers, weez niggaz is off the rocker

Sippin cranberry juice on rocks with vodka
With 'Pac and Poppa, and Redd Fox's doctor
Takin' names and takin' orders
Ya fake ya name and I'm all up on ya

Nigga that's California, palm trees and 6-3's on deez
Rims dip to make the spokes gold-a
Slangin' boulders, thought I told ya
True soldiers comin' from the motherfuckin' shoulders

Take it easy
'Cuz it's the motherfuckin' knoc
Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin' cops
Bow down when ya see me
Knoc the truth best believe it

Take it easy
'Cuz it's the motherfuckin' knoc
Hotter than a freak who givin' head who won't stop
Bow down when ya pass thru
Knoc turn'al god damn you

What's the difference between us? Nah, not that again
New songs and new cars and new broads and new thongs
On Crenshaw Boulevard, line 'em up at the bar
Girl you know who we are, hip-hop superstars



Roll deep, nah, we roll hard and deep
Bogart yo beef get the fuck off my street
Getcha motherfuckin' ass beat
L.A., Compton, long beach, whooptie whoop nigga what?

I don't give a fuck
Hustlers, hood-rats, sick-ass thugs, crips and bloods
Hell nigga, all my real niggaz raise it up
Nuttin' but dubs, you got a sack, nigga what? Blaze it up

Take it easy
'Cuz it's the motherfuckin' knoc
Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin' cops
Bow down when ya see me
Knoc the truth best believe it

Take it easy
'Cuz it's the motherfuckin' knoc
Hotter than a freak who givin' head who won't stop
Bow down when ya pass thru
Knoc turn'al god damn you

Bitch, you ain't 'bout shit, my bad
Turn off the lights, don't trip
Give a nig' some ack right and act like
You might lick balls tonight

Girls all pause, hell nah, girls drop draws on site
Do drugs, shroom cups, smoke bud, all night
That's right, I like bisexual women, fuck dykes
Suck dick, no, but your father might

Fuckin' hermaphrodite
Duck the IRS, fuckin' Howard Stern's wife
In traffic, bitch gave me head in real life
L.A. city lights, C.A. get it right

Westcoast on the grind, these niggaz done lost they minds
Straight loungin' in the sunshine
Here's one thing you bitch niggaz must know
Fuck you, please believe that and I mean that

Take it easy
'Cuz it's the motherfuckin' knoc
Hotter than yo' block fulla motherfuckin' cops
Bow down when ya see me

Boo yaa, right about now I'ma got to drop some flyyyyyy

And I'ma drop the bomb like this to you

[Verse 1: ~Cold 187Um~]
Now, here's another way to get payin'
I'm million dollar nigga, not the million dollar man
G, I break a bitch like class
And if she give up a lyin' I put foot into her ass
Nigga, I smoke weed sometimes with the street hustlers
But you can cope some dope wine, and toss some 40s like a motherfucker
I think it's.. I'm about to move some fly shit up
I play it from the Old to New School, trick school up
You hooked to my style like a fiend on coke
It's like the moral junky you get, the mortal junky smoke
I don't slip, but I stalk with the whip 
Cause I'm vocally pimpin, while I'm proud I'm gifted
But yo, once I'm pimpin, the whores all know I got a gang of them
Who gives a fuck if she claims somethin?
Cause late at night, I got the creeps on a whore
I throw a penny at the window, she be ready to go "OOOHHH"
I wouldn't treat like a sneak, I treated her just like a queen
Take straight to the Mongareen, and did the wild thing
Yo, then I went back to the set
And if my homies ain't stossin' out, I'm takin' none of bitches 
Until it's gone if my homies can't have some "Sure baby"
What's the matter baby, I thought you wanna have some?
Cause you whore, is not our whores
And incase you didn't know, your bitch swings low
Flipped into a spot on a strip, break a fool off a mega somethin'
So don't trip cause I'm a South Central player and I gotta admit it
Last fool tried to fade this, we got him ass kicked
They call me a G but I ain't never gangbanged "Gangster"
Maybe because all the Keys I slanged
They call me hustler cause the money I make
You know, why they call you a player? ---> KM.G
Maybe because all the bitches I break

[Break:]
NOW HOLD UP, WAIT A MINUTE!!
Yeah, the industry is the filthy and I'm all up in it
NOW HOLD UP, IS IT SLICK?

[Verse 2: ~Cold 187Um~]
Don't worry about it, baby, cause I got a fat dick
So here we go, here we go, here we go, C-O-L-D
187Um from the A-T-L Posse
How you gonna tell me where I'm ought to be within or where I been?
Understand where I'm comin' from?
How you gonna tell me that you digged me when you digged whack dumbs?
They don't wanna understand where I'm comin' from ---> KM.G
No, I'm finna blockin' the bridges, just from these broke ass niggaz
Who steal the rag from the flag and comin' up much faker
Cause I say: about ten years from now, I'll be finicially stable 
And I can probably take the piles on a turn, look back over the field
To see my Ups and Downs, to see the caps I peeled
And see the people who are still, down for the crown
You know, I have to give a shout out to the underground "That was fly"
So players, let's just chill cause things are better
And remember like mostly boy, nothin' changes but the weather
Cause I'm the Coldest, the Colder, the 187
The one that's known to put the fly pimp shit together

[KM.G:]
Plus, me the KM.G the mega dick on call
I'm the one that's known for bumpin' the walls

[Cold 187Um:]
And in the back, who's that?

Some call him strawberry known as Total K-Oss

Here's one thing you bitch niggaz must know
Fuck you! Please believe that, and I mean that

LYRICS:
Como no vengas pronto a por mi me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.[BIS]

Con una sonrisa todo cambia de color.
Me siento más atrevida la vida tiene otro sabor.
Hoy apuesto al ganador pienso jugarme el resto por tu amor. Hoy no me digas que no, que ya va siendo tiempo que este momento lo guarde todo para ti.

Como no vengas pronto a por mi, me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.
Como no vengas pronto a por mi, me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.

Moviendo así tus caderas ponte conmigo a bailar.
De nada sirve escaparte hoy mi chico tu serás.

Hoy apuesto al ganador este partido es de mi corazón.
Hoy te lo pido por favor, dame solo un segundo que de mi mundo lo guardo todo para ti.

Como no vengas pronto a por mi, me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.
Como no vengas pronto a por mi, me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.
Como no vengas pronto a por mi, me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.
Como no vengas pronto a por mi, me da en la nariz que otro lo hará por ti.

Como no vengas pronto a por mi.
