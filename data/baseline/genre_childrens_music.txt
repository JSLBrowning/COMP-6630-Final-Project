TITLE: The Goldfish Lyrics
LYRICS:
Lots of little fish were sleeping on a rock
In the bottom of the ocean
They lifted up their heads
And they shook out their tails
And they said let's go swimming

Let's go swimming lets go swimming
Yeah let's go swimming
Let's go swimming let's go swimming In the bottom of the ocean
Then the little fish got so very very tired
That they came back to the rock
And they put own their heads
And they put down their tails
And they took a little nap

And when they woke up
They decided to take a shower

So whey washed their hair
And they washed their ears
And they washed their tummies
And they washed their beards
And they washed their nose
And they washed their toes
And then they said

"Wait a minute, we're fish!
We don't take showers!"

Let's go swimming let's go swimming…
Then the little fish got so very very tired…

And when woke up
They decided to brush their teeth

So they got out their tooth brush
And their toothpaste
And they squeezed a little on
They tried not to waste
And they put it in their mouth
They brushed north and south
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch
And then they said,

"Wait a minute, we're fish!
We don't brush our teeth!:

Let's go swimming lets go swimming…
Then the little shigh got so very very tired…

And when they woke up
They decided to ride their bicycles

So they rode to the left
And they rode to the right
And they rode all day
And they rode all night
They rode down the hill
And then faster still
And then they said,

"Wait a minute, we're fish!
We don't ride bicycles!"

Let's go swimming…
Let's go swimming…

LYRICS:
Now old Dan Tucker was a fine old man
Washed his face in a frying pan
Combed his hair with a wagon wheel
Died with a toothache in his heel

Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Old Dan Tucker, he's come to town
Riding a billy goat, leading a hound
Hound dog barked and the billy goat jumped
Landed Dan Tucker on top of the stump

Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Now old Dan Tucker sat on a trunk
And fell in the fire and kicked up a chunk
Red-hot coal fall down in his shoe
Oh my Lord, how the ashes flew

Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Now old Dan Tucker has come to town
Swinging the ladies round and round
First to the right and then to the left
Then to the girl that he loves best

Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper
Get out of the way, old Dan Tucker
You're too late to get your supper

I used to have an accountant named Fred Fishkin. My new accountant is Vito of Vasco Accounting. I knew there was a song in there. Why this song? I don't know. It took on a life of it's own.

Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco
Ate a burrito with Tabasco
They put it on their rice
They put it on their beans
On their rutabagas
And on their collard greens

Hey Victor (Hey Victory)
Hey Freddie (Hey Freddie)
Let's eat some (Let's eat some)
Spaghetti (Spaghetti)
Hey Victor (Hey Victor)
I'm ready (I'm ready)
To eat some spaghetti with Freddie

Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco
Moved from El Cerrito all the way to Alaska
Oh they ate their rice they ate their beans
They ate their rutabagas
And they ate their collard greens

Hey Victor…

Victor Vito and Freddie Vasco
They like to eat slow they never eat fast
Oh they ate their rice they ate their beans
They ate their rutabagas
And they ate their collard greens

Hey Victor…

They like to eat fast they never eat slow Oh they ate their rice they ate their beans
They ate their rutabagas

I look in the mirror and what do I see?
Two big eyes staring out at me
They look at me so brightly and I can see
There's no one as lovely in the world as me

I look in the mirror and what do I see?
One little nose sticking out from me
I use it to smell everything everyday
And there's no nose as lovely as mine I say

I look in the mirror and what do I see?
One big smile smiling straight at me
It's shining so brightly and I can see
There's no one as lovely in the world as me

I look in the mirror and what do I see?
One happy face looking out at me
I feel so happy that I'm here today
And there's no one as happy as me I say
There's no one as lovely as me I say

Unlike a yo-yo craze,
unlike a marble phase,
I love it every day
spaghetti bolognese
unlike a hop-scotch craze
unlike a knucklebone phase
i love it every day

spaghetti bolognese

chicken and coleslaw
three times a week
salad and pizza
good for a treat
but as i have the
pick of the menu,
i chose the same thing every day coz...

Unlike a yo-yo craze,
unlike a marble phase,
I love it every day
spaghetti bolognese
unlike a hop-scotch craze
unlike a knucklebone phase
i love it every day
spaghetti bolognese
i love it everyday
spaghetti bolognese

hot apple crumble i like eat
cherries and ice-cream they're hard to beat
but when it comes to
something that's special
something that's chewy
something scrunches

Unlike a yo-yo craze,
unlike a marble phase,
I love it every day
spaghetti bolognese
unlike a hop-scotch craze
unlike a knucklebone phase
i love it every day
spaghetti bolognese
i love it everyday
spaghetti bolognese

Unlike a yo-yo craze,
unlike a marble phase,

TITLE: Jack & The Beanstalk Lyrics
LYRICS:
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
Be he alive, or be he dead
I'll grind his bones to make my bread

Jack climbed the beanstalk, he was only ten years old
And watched as the giant was counting up his gold
The giant soon got sleepy, he soon began to snore
Jack grabbed a bag of gold and quickly scampered out the door

And down the beanstalk Jack scurried
Close to the ground he jumped and hurried
Back to his mum who was very worried
Look mum we don't have to be poor anymore

Fe Fi Fo Fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
Be he alive, or be he dead
I'll grind his bones to make my bread

Jack climbed the beanstalk on the very next day again
He found the giant wide awake and talking to his hen
Lay me a golden egg he heard the giant say
And when the giant fell asleep Jack stole the hen away

And down the beanstalk Jack scurried
Close to the ground he jumped and hurried
Back to his mum who was very worried
Look mum we don't have to be poor anymore

Fe Fi Fo Fum
I smell the blood of an Englishman
Be he alive, or be he dead
I'll grind his bones to make my bread

Jack's mother begged him to never climb up again
But Jack said just one more time and that will be the end
He crept up to the giant who was playing a magic harp
And quick as a flash and without a sound he snatched it in the dark

And down the beanstalk Jack scurried
Close to the ground he jumped and hurried
Back to his mum who was very worried
One blow with the axe down under
The giant fell with a crash like thunder
Jack said look mum, the giant's dead
We don't have to be poor anymore

LYRICS:
Yesterday I had a body and a tail
A body and a tail, body and a tail
Yesterday I had a body and a tail
Today I've got two legs as well

What is happening to me
Whatever can it be
I'm not very happy and that's because
I liked the way I was

Well blow me down, it's happenin' again
Happenin' again, happenin' again
Blow me down, it's happenin' again
There's two legs growing at the front as well

What is happening to me
Whatever can it be
I'm not very happy and that's because
I liked the way I was

Uh oh, what's going on, my tail is getting shor-orter
Tail is getting shor-orter, tail is getting shor-orter
What's going on, my tail is getting shor-orter
It's going, going, gone - oh no

What is happening to me
Whatever can it be
I'm not very happy and that's because
I liked the way I was

Well now I'm a frog and I've more or less got used to it
More or less got used to it, more or less got used to it
But sometimes a tadpole swims up to have a quiet chat
And I know what he's going to say

What is happening to me
Whatever can it be
I'm not very happy and that's because
I liked the way I was

Now listen - it's really rather nice to be a frog
And live at the bottom of a bog
So don't be concerned or worry about a thing
Come on and sing-sing-sing
