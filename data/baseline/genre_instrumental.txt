LYRICS:
Only in this moment will my heart remain beside you
Only in this moment will our passions stay aligned
Lost in love's embrace is where our memories lie

Amar es todo dar...perdoname (forgive me too)
Es que no pense (it hurts in me)
And you

Juntos podemos seguir
Darle otro rumbo a esta historia
We give it from time but you and I
Survived through it all
Dime que puedes sentir
Que no termine este sueño
But this song in chance love has a chance
To prove what we knew all along

[Chorus]
Somos dos sueños del tiempo
Baila conmigo en el viento
Desnuda tus sentimientos
Hasta el ultimo momento
Mi todo eres tu

Solo soy libre a tu lado
El miedo quedo en el pasado
Fulfill me now with this endless vow
To live as never before
(repeat chorus 2x)

Hasta el ultimo momento...

LYRICS:
What's underneath the warmest water
What's in your dreams that's like no other
Are you alone
Are you alright now

Let your secrets out
Let me just find out

Look into my eyes
Leave it all behind

Let's get in the deep
Look into my eyes
Let's get in the deep
Leave the rest behind
Let's get in the deep
And see what we can find

LYRICS:
Come hear my heart cry, breathe in your moonlight
Take me away
Come feel my yearning forever burn
Love make me alive

Dive into fire, feel my desire, you are known and safe
You'll find my heart will love to
Let passion ignite lust for the night
Come make me alive

I hear your call and I run to you
Come fill my soul with love I never knew
Our love makes me fly high
Oh, love makes me rise alive
Take me

Come hear my heart cry, breathe in your moonlight
Take me away
You'll find my heart will love to
Come feel my yearning forever burn
Love make me alive

Love will take me

LYRICS:
It was raining in my heart
Falling deep inside of me
Drowning into my soul
This silence rushes over me

I am breath against this fire
And I will not turn away, oh no
I'm waiting for time to carry me
Like a tempest to the sea
Standing strong, watching over, yeah

Love will keep me believing
Through the dark, can you hear me calling?
Holding on when I'm dreaming
Love is all, love is all, love is all

Thundering on high
Love was all I knew before I fell
And now the shots of man
Are buried inside myself

I am breath against this fire
And I will not turn away, oh no
I'm waiting for time to carry me
Like a tempest to the sea
Standing strong, watching over, yeah

Love will keep me believing
Through the dark, can you hear me calling?
Holding on when I'm dreaming
Love is all, love is all, love is all
Holding on when I'm dreaming
Love is all, love is all

Love will keep me believing
Through the dark, can you hear me calling?
Holding on when I'm dreaming
Love is all, love is all, love is all

Like a tempest to the sea, I'm standin'
Love is all, love is all, love is all
Love is all, love is all, love is all
Like a tempest to the sea
I'm standin', I'm standin' [Incomprehensible]
Love, love, love , love is all

Love is all

LYRICS:
Standing in line marking time
Waiting for the welfare dime
'Cause they can't buy a job
The man in the silk suit hurries by
As he catches the poor old ladies' eyes
"Just for fun", he says, "Get a job"

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
But don't you believe them

They say, "Hey little boy you can't go where the others go
'Cause you don't look like they do"
Said,"Hey old man, how can you stand to think that way?
Did you really think about it
Before you made the rules?"
He said, "Son"

"That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
But don't you believe them"

That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

Well, they passed a law in '64
To give those who ain't got a little more
But it only goes so far
Because the law another's mind
When all it sees at the hiring time
Is the line on the color bar

That's just the way it is
Some things will never change
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is, it is, it is, it is

LYRICS:
I close my eyes to see the world
I close my eyes so that it won't hurt
I'm sailing on blue ocean and flying to you

I catch my breathe under the full moon
A star that shines, so pleased to meet you
Maybe I'll dream forever
And I'd like to love right here

Before the night ends
And dawn of a new day dawns
How I hope, how I hope

That out of this endless blue
Somehow I will find you
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

I made a choice more than a few times
To walk a road that didn't end up so right

But I want to go the distance
I'd like to love right here

Before the night ends
And dawn of a new day dawns
How I hope, how I hope

That out of this endless blue
Somehow I will find you
Before the night ends
Before the night ends

Close my eyes
Never gonna let up

Before the night ends
I hope I find you

LYRICS:
Grazie alla nostra grandezza
alle cose che giá abbiamo raggiunto
siamo in questo tempo
dove abbiamo superato molti ostacoli
della storia.

Siamo andati ache sulla luna
attraversato oceani e mari
abbiamo la conoscenza
per salvare una vita
Oooh, se possiamo fare tutte queste cose
quale sará il limita dell'umanitá.

Niente é cosí lontano
i sogni sono realtá
Vieni con me
april it tuo orizzonte
senza frontieri
uniremo il mondo
vieni con me e sogniamo
vieni con me
la nostra forza vincerá
grazie anche a te.

Viviamo in tempo di guerra
dove manca l'amore
c'e poca poesia
torniamo alla terra
dove l'amore é piú forte dell'odio

Vale la pena dominare il mondo
se ci dimentichiamo del rispetto
se poi non diamo una mano
per chi soffre e non ha niente
ma parché continuare a distruggere
se la forza della vita é stare insieme in armonia

Niente é cosí lontano
i sogni sono realtá
Vieni con me
april it tuo orizzonte
senza frontieri
uniremo il mondo
vieni con me e sogniamo
vieni con me
la nostra forza vincerá
grazie anche a te
Sogniamo, sogniamo.

LYRICS:
I've been like a bird without song for awhile
Dry like a lake without rain for awhile
You suddenly stepped in my life
and made me cry, like an angel
Ooh, you're something else, like a smile without end

Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper

You're pulling me closer and you're flowin' in
With every emotion that rushes me on
To your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

I've been like a home without people for awhile
Empty like a poem without words for awhile
You suddenly stepped in my life
And made me shine, like a diamond
Ooh, you're somethin' else, like a dream without end

Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper
(All I have)
You're pulling me closer and you're flowin' in
(All I have)
With every emotion rushes me on
To your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

Aah

Ooh, you're something else, like a dream without end
Come into my life
Go a little deeper
Come into my life
You could be the keeper
(All I have)
You're pulling me closer and you're flowin' in
(All I have)
With every emotion rushes me on
To your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

All I have
All I have
Turn me on to your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper
Turn me on to your love, light me up
Oh, you could be the keeper

LYRICS:
[Good - Bye]
Oh how I’m so far away, 
I won't need to die today, 
I must go into﻿ the sea,
And carry you away with me, 
Oh I will hold your mouth in mine,
Like I have time after time, 
Give you all breath real slowly, 
Take your heart beats silently, 
It will be mine no heart of mine,
No more will taste of your kind, 
Sink in the cold absence, 
Lay you down for your decedent, 
This will be the darkest time, 
To see your body part from mine, 
Watch the water rest, 
Oh how time may will do that
[Good Bye]
TITLE: The Darkest Time Lyrics

LYRICS:
Why are we fighting, why are we lying
Maybe God come and help me out
But He can't see the damned in this crowd

Did I lose it all, how did I miss the call
Conform me to an image of a doll
Break me up against His wall

I can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving, just set me free

Can you please forgive me
Words can't say the makings
Buildings crumble down under
And lovers crash at the sound of thunder

I once believed honesty was key
But I can't stay and live this way
'Cause every time I stand you take it away

I can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving, just set me free

Once I was young, now I'm old enough
To see the truth that hides in me

I can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving, just set me free

I just can't look in the mirror
And see myself standing there
All I see is an illusion
Fighting a war against the ones who care
No need for saving, just set me free

on the grayest of days
it seemed so clear
my reflection raised
felt your skin so near

movements slow
i need to know
movements slow
i need to know

forgotten how to crave
a warmth like this
you tighten the hands
around my wrists

as we shiver
i must not rest
all will unfold
with what is left

movements slow
i need to know
how this will never end
how i will gain control

movements slow
i need to know

on the grayest of days
it seemed so clear
my reflection raised
i felt you so near

movements slow
i need to know
movements slow
i need to know
movements slow
i need to know
movements slow
i need to know

take me for what it's worth
while our motion disappears
i am here right now
while i motion disappears
and when morning comes
i will be all, all yours

take me for what it's worth
while our motion disappears
i am here right now
while our motion disappears
and when morning comes
i will be all, all yours

on the grayest of days
it seemed so clear
my reflection raised
i felt you so near

So why don't you lay with me
Oh I will show you things that you will need
And I will, I will do anything for you, my baby
These are the hardest days so take me on a ride oh please
Hop in, fasten your seat, we'll be such goodies (?)
Show me how do that how you move like that uh huh
Oh I want to get closer get lucky
Show me how do that how you move like that uh huh
Oh I want to get closer get lucky
So why don't you lay with me
Oh I will show you things that you will need
And I will I will do anything for you, my baby
Try (?) will never stop how we are so very young
These summer night have just begun
Lets plan nothing underneath the hot sun Come over here and whisper in my ear What you're scared of and what you fear
I ain't leavin' oh I'm just thinkin'
How bad I want you and how much I've been drinkin'
So why don't you lay with me
Oh I will show you things that you will need
And I will, I will do anything for you my baby
Oh baby I know that we will always be just you and me
Oh I know just a little more
I will never leave your heart sore
Oh I know I will give you all
All I have, baby I am all you need
Oh baby, I will always be for you and me.

Scenes From The Southside
The Show Goes On
B. r. hornsby

What's the long face, whats all the crying for
Didn't you expect it when you opened your door
To the man with the long coat and the long list of victims
Everybody watching knows he's the one keeping score
>from where she sits, everyone stands in judgement
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade...

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on, as the autumn's coming
And the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Some say she's alright, some say she'll never learn
Some rush into things, some stand and wait their turn
I've been here all along standing here all this time
But you never noticed, just let the same tired flames burn
>from where she sits, everyone stands in judgement
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade

The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on, as the autumn's coming
And the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

Time is passing,slowly passing you by
You better try to find it before it passes you by
As i watch you walking to another cold dawn
And you keep on walking
And they keep on talking
Talking all along

>from where she sits, everyone stands in judgement
People watching as the curtain falls down
See the lights do a long slow fade
The show goes on, and the sad-eyed sisters go walking on
Everyone watching all along
The show goes on, as the autumn's coming
And the summer's all gone
Still without you, the show goes on

LYRICS:
Only in this moment
Will my heart remind beside you
Only in this moment
Will a pacence stay alive

Lost in love in braces
We will memory fly

Amar es tolerar... perdoname
Forgive me too
Es que no pense
It hurts in me
And you...

Juntos podemos seguir
Darle otro rumbo a esta historia
Togheter from time
Dime que puedes sentir
With the song and tell
Love at the chance to prove
But we know all the love

Somos los duenos del tiempo
Baila conmigo en el viento
Desnuda tus sentimientos
Hasta el ultimo momento
Mi todo eres tu

Oh you!

Solo soy libre a tu lado
Hear me now
With this silence votes
To live as never before

Somos los duenos del tiempo
Baila conmigo en el viento
Desnuda tus sentimientos
Hasta el ultimo momento
Mi todo eres tu

Hasta el ultimo momento...

LYRICS:
You were so close to the cliff
I didn't even care to notice
Rain fell over our heads
My throat trembled and said

I cover myself with your eyes
Cover myself for the first time
See to it that I will have you
Capture you when the warmth comes

Learn how your body moves
When I am next to you
You are the whiskey on my lips
Holding it when I am so far

I choose to forget your name
Far away it will all be the same
Have you break me oh in two
Every time I have to leave you

[Chorus:]
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly

This will come down so hard
We will ache for a new start
In so oh absent arms
To this we'll fall apart

I will arrive on a rainy day
Show face oh at your door
You will tell me all the ways
That I will want you more

On my living room floor
So well I will explore
I will feel this even when
I cannot breathe you in

I don't remember the taxi ride
You will forget how I feel on the insides
This will mean nothing in time
In time this will mean nothing

[Chorus:]
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly

Please don't you think of me
In time this will mean nothing

Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly
Please don't you think of me
I'm nothing honestly

Please don't you think of me
In time this will mean nothing

LYRICS:
Scendono le nuvole
Oscurando la speranza
Mentre le stelle e la Luna
Sembrano sparire

Dopo l’inverno
C’è la primavera
Nuova vita per ricominciare

Dopo la notte
Sorge il Sole
E forse c'è una luce nell’oscurità

O Luce che brilla nell’oscurità
Guidami nel mio cammino
E quando mi sento solo
Accompagnami sulle stelle

Il chiasso della gente
Grida indifferente
Abbandonato al suolo
Solo cerco la pace
E sono ancora qui
C’è paura in me
Alzo gli occhi al cielo

E prego a Dio, devo trovare
Quella luce che si è persa nell’oscurità

O luce che brilla nell’oscurità
Guidami nel mio cammino
E quando mi sento solo
Accompagnami sulle stelle

C’è una calda primavera
Per ogni freddo inverno

If there’s light that shines in the darkest night
Fetch me out through the mist and (others drown? other strand? others grand?)
And when my cries find no relief,
Guide me along the way...

O luce che brilla nell’oscurità
Guidami nel mio cammino
E quando mi sento solo
Accompagnami sulle stelle

Accompagnami, accompagnami
Sulle stelle lassù

Show me how far you'd go
Keep all our secrets safe and i would do anything
If you, oh, want me to
I will do if you say so
Tell me, oh, what you need 
And I won't say no, oh no

Undone, a shot unheard 
To the depths of my golden sun
If you were to lie to me
Oh, to the death i'd see

Wallow in a trail of absence
Oh, how I long for you
I long for you

Quiet now, oh, we must not tell 
A single soul about this tale
To the grave no one will know
This is ours not to tell, oh oh

Oh no, oh no, oh no...

Show me, oh, how I should
Show me how far you'd go
Keep all our secrets safe and I would do anything
