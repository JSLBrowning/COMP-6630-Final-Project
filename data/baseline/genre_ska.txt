TITLE: Patience Lyrics
LYRICS:
(*Jones, Marley, Amadou Bajayoko, Mariam Doumbia)


Here we are*
Here we are.
Yeah.
This one right here is for the people.

[Chorus:]
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontÃª
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye
Ni kÃªra mÃ´gÃ´
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontÃª
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni
Ni kÃªra mÃ´gÃ´

Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the west
Will never move east
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord

[Chorus:]
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontÃª
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye
Ni kÃªra mÃ´gÃ´
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontÃª
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni
Ni kÃªra mÃ´gÃ´

Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round if the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things that he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out the root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze and that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wed mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive, Against All Odds, Now?

[Chorus:]
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontÃª
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kiye
Ni kÃªra mÃ´gÃ´
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, yonkontÃª
Sabali, Sabali, Sabali, kagni
Ni kÃªra mÃ´gÃ´

Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hu? what's man? what's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cause
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'pardon me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn.

TITLE: One Day Lyrics
LYRICS:
Sometimes I lay under the moon
And I thank God I'm breathin'
Then I pray don't take me soon
'Cause I am here for a reason

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because

All my life I been waitin' for
I been prayin' for, for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play, one day

It's not about win or lose 'cause we all lose
When they feed on the souls of the innocent blood
Drenched pavement keep on movin'
Though the waters stay ragin'

And in this life you may lose your way
It might drive you crazy
But don't let it phase you, no way

Sometimes in my tears I drown
But I never let it get me down
So when negativity surrounds
I know someday it'll all turn around because

All my life I been waitin' for
I been prayin' for, for the people to say
That we don't want to fight no more
They'll be no more wars
And our children will play, one day

One day this all will change
Treat people the same
Stop with the violence down with the hate
One day we'll all be free and proud
To be under the same sun
Singing songs of freedom like

TITLE: Time Bomb Lyrics
LYRICS:
You've seen her at a party, 
She's doing her rounds
She likes to get it started, 
She likes to get loud 
She's poppin that champagne, 
She's taking shots down 
She's living for the moment

She's a time bomb,
Trying to take you out,
The ticking of her heart
Is the only sound
She's a time bomb,
About to detonate
You try to cut her wires
But you're too late

Whisky stain on her dress now, 
She's wearing it proud 
And there's nothing you can tell her, 
'Cuz she's starting to shout 
Now she's spraying that champagne, 
All over the crowd 
She's living for the moment

She's a time bomb, 
trying to take you out, 
The ticking of her heart
Is the only sound 
She's a time bomb, 
about to detonate 
You try to cut her wires
But you're way too late

She's a time bomb, 
trying to take you out, 
The ticking of her heart
Is the only sound 
She's a time bomb, 
about to detonate 
You try to cut her wires
But you're, too late

She's a time bomb, 
trying to take you out, 
The ticking of her heart 
Is the only sound 
She's a time bomb, 
about to detonate 
You try to cut her wires

TITLE: Wasn't Me Lyrics
LYRICS:
(Yo man)
Yo
(Open up man)
What do you want man?
(My girl just caught me)
You let her catch you?
(I don't know how I let this happen)

With who?
(The girl next door, you know?)
Man
(I don't know what to do)
Say it wasn't you
(Alright)

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

How you can grant the woman access to your villa
Trespasser and a witness while you cling on your pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Best for you and the situation not to call the beaner

To be a true player you have to know how to play
If she say you're not, convince her say you're gay
Never admit to a word when she say makes a claim
And you tell her baby no way

But she caught me on the counter
(Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower
(Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera
(Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder
(Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her
(Wasn't me)
Heard the screams getting louder
(Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

I had tried to keep her from
What she was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me

Make sure she knows it's not you
And lead her on da right prefix
Whenever you should see her make da gigolo flex
As funny as it be by you, it not that complex

Seein' is believin' so you better change your specs
You know she not gonna be worrying 'bout things from the past
Hardly recollecting and then she'll go to noontime mass
Rik-boy, your answer, go over there but if she pack a gun
You know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter
(Wasn't me)
Saw me banging on the sofa
(Wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower
(Wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera
(Wasn't me)

She saw the marks on my shoulder
(Wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her
(Wasn't me)
Heard the screams getting louder
(Wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

Gonna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all

We should tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost, that's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creeping with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt-naked
Banging on the bathroom floor

How could I forget
That I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standing there
She never took her eyes off me

I'm not in this world
To live up to your expectations
Neither are you here to live up to mine, yeah

I don't owe no one no obligation
No I don't mean none
So everything is fine, fine

I am that I am, I am, I am, I am
I am that I am, I am, I am, I am
I am that I am, I am, I am, I am"

Don't underestimate my ability
Don't definate my character
Don't belittle my authority
It is time you recognized my quality

I said, "I am that I am, I am, I am, I am
I am that I am, I am, I am, I am"
I said, "I am that I am, I am, I am, I am
I am that I am, I am, I am, I am"

Learn to love to love your brother
Don't covet your neighbor
Flee from the city it's getting shitty
It is full of out-a-quity

I said, "I am that I am, I am, I am, I am
I am that I am, I am, I am, I am
I am that I am, I am, I am, I am"

I am the rock of the ages you cannot move I at all
I am the son of lightning you cannot move I at all
Son of Jacob cannot be moved at all

I am the son of Moses you can't move I at all
I am the son of David you cannot move I at all
I am a firm ripe diamond you cannot move I at all
You could a shed more tears you cannot move I at all

You could a full of evil you cannot move I at all
You could a try more nuttin' you cannot move I at all

You're living out there, surrounded by blue*
Lush green eyes, sand on your shoes
You're home and I dream of you
Remember those times?
You could make a fantasy appear in real life
Every time I leave you now I have to think twice
And dream of you
And it's true, there's nowhere quite like you
It's about time that you knew
You're home and I

Dream of you I dream
Dream of you I dream
Dream of you I dream
You're home and I

When I'm lost out there, you're easy to find
I close my eyes, you're in my mind
You're home and I dream of you
December sunshine, the only memories are ones that make me feel fine
Just know we'll be together when I see you in my dream of you

And it's true, there's nowhere quite like you

The world is turning around
When today becomes tomorrow
When lies are said to be truth
The future becomes the past

LYRICS:
Girl you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me baby
Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl you're my friend when I'm in need lady

Life is one big party when you're still young
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done?
It's all good when you live you have pure fun
Can't be a fool son what about the long run

Looking back shorty always I mention
Said me not giving her much attention
She was there through my incarceration
I wanna show the nation my appreciation

Girl you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me baby
Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl you're my friend when I'm in need lady

You're a queen and so you should be treated
Though you never get the lovin' that you're needed
Could've left but I called and you heeded
Begged and I pleaded mission completed

Mama said that I and I dissed the program
I'm not the type to mess around with your emotion
But the feeling that I have for you is so strong
Been together so long and this could never be wrong

Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me baby
Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl you're my friend when I'm in need lady

Girl in spite of my behavior say "I'm your savior"
You must be sent from up above
And you appear to me so tender well girl I surrender
Thanks for giving me your love

Girl in spite of my behavior well you are my savior
You must be sent from up above
And you appear to me so tender well girl I surrender
Thanks for giving me your love

Now life is one big party when you're still young
And who's gonna have your back when it's all done?
It's all good when you live you have
Can't be a fool son what about the long run

Looking back shorty always I mention
Said me not giving her much attention
She was there through my incarceration
I wanna show the nation my appreciation

Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me baby
Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl you're my friend when I'm in need lady

Heaven must be missing on angel
'Coz you are here with me
Heaven must be missing on angel
'Coz you are here with me

Heaven must be missing on angel
'Coz you are here with me
Heaven must be missing on angel
'Coz you are here with me

Girl you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me lady
Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl you're my friend when I'm in need

Girl you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me baby
Shorty you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl you're my friend when I'm in need baby

TITLE: Let Me Inside Lyrics
LYRICS:
It’s cold outside and I want in
The rain pours down and I wear thin
There’s something more that I can’t see
And can you tell me what it might be?
Til then I’ll be hanging on tightly

And I don’t know much
But I can feel it ever time that we touch
It’s what you do to me

It’s the fire in your eyes
It’s the way your real thoughts hide
It’s the way you make me try
Ooh and when you tell me lies
Let me inside, Let me inside, Let me inside

You’re all shut in and you can’t hide
I knock knock knock
I knock all night to no reply
There’s a light on that I can see
And can you tell me what it might be?
I’m here as long as it shines brightly
And I don’t know much
But I can feel it ever time that we touch
It’s what you do to me

It’s the fire in your eyes
It’s the way your real thoughts hide
It’s the way you make me try
Ooh and when you tell me lies
Let me inside, Let me inside, Let me inside

TITLE: Get Back To Me Lyrics
LYRICS:
You, I think it was half past three*
You spilled your Jim and Coke on me
Left the party half past four
Had to sneak into your dorm
Left before the sun had shown
Trippin' all over your clothes
As I shut the door to 213
I heard your voice from the bed say

Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you to
Get back to me, get back to me
I'm waiting for you

I always living on the fly
Used to think about you and I
Hoping someday that we could be
I'm thinking that some day we should be
You
I'm tired of wasting time
You probably found another guy
And now I'm messaging your iPhone
Because you're in another time zone

TITLE: Close to You Lyrics
LYRICS:
She was a Jezebel, this burstin' queen
Livin' her life like a bad sweet dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' around like a wheel on fire
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
When I'm lying in the midnight hour
Holding you just like a dream
Love is never what it seems

When we touch
And you're holdin' me the way you feel
Girl, you make my dreams come true
You make my dreams come true

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She was a Gemini on the cusp of Mars
She holds me back but she goes too far
Windin' me up just to let me down
So emotional gagged and bound

There's more to this than meets the eye
A devil woman locked inside
With the formal risin' I was scared
I think I was possessed

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I feel love
Everytime your body's next to mine
Somethin' deep inside of me
Wants to love you endlessly

When we touch
Girl, you don't know how it makes me feel
I just can't believe it's real
I can't believe it's real

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

She had an attitude I can't explain
You never know if you're in flame
Tying me up with elastic words
I'm on a countdown till I get hurt

Her blood was hot she burned so bright
A neon sign there in the night
It's hard to say if I went too far
My heart still bears a scar

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

She was a Jezebel, this burstin' queen
Livin' her life like a bad sweet dream
Tellin' me lies when the truth was clear
I think she knew what I wanted to hear

Spinnin' around like a wheel on fire
Walkin' the tightrope on love's highwire
A fatal attraction is where I'm at
There's no escapin' me

I wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel

I just wanna be close to you
And do all the things you want me to
I just wanna be close to you
And show you the way I feel
