LYRICS:
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 1: Mark Morrison]
Well, I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know
As the saddest story goes
Baby, now I got the flo'
Cause I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again
And to show you that I'm with

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask

[Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back
Return of the Mack

[Verse 2: Mark Morrison]
So, I'm back up in the game (hustling sound)
Running things to keep my swing (whole night long)
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
Cause what you did you know was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done (oh oh oh)
So baby listen carefully while I sing my comeback song
Squah!

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison & Fetty Wap]
You lied to me
All those times I said that I loved you
You lied to me
Oh my god baby
Dare I ask
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, there it is
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Cause the money ain't enough
I remember when it was
I had dreams of being up
I ain't never leave you stuck (oh my god)
And you say you will never turn on me, baby, aye
You played me like a tournament, baby, aye
You know I gave you the best of me, baby
Oh man, I thought you were next to me, baby
I guess I gotta show you I am the one that you were with
That got you swerving in the whip
And putting diamonds on your wrists, baby
Still making hit after hit, baby
I bet you'll let me hit after this

[Pre-Hook: Mark Morrison]
You lied to me, all this pain you said I'd never feel
You lied to me, but I do, but I do, do, do

[Hook: Mark Morrison]
Return of the Mack, yea
Return of the Mack, come on
Return of the Mack, oh my God
You know that I'll be back, here I am
Return of the Mack, once again
Return of the Mack, top of the world
Return of the Mack, watch my flow
You know that I'll be back, here I go

[Verse 1]
Feel the distortion cut through your veins
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
Crush me with the 808's
Ceilings are breaking
So high we could fly
Make it rough, make it rough now
Forget about a reason why

[Pre-Chorus]
We are one and the same
Dancing close to the edge
Feel the hit your brain
Take it right to the head

[Chorus]
Distortion
We do what we want
Turn that shit on
Cause I wanna feel more than I've ever felt before
Distortion
We do what we love
Turn that shit up
Cause I wanna feel more, more, more
(Make it rough now)

[Verse 2]
Now that were moving, cut to the chase
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
Let the rythm penetrate
Just what we needed
So sweet to the taste
Make it rough, make it rough now
Let’s blow it away

[Pre-Chorus]
We are one and the same
Dancing close to the edge
Feel the hit your brain
Take it right to the head

We do what we want
Turn that shit on

[Verse 1: Noonie Bao]
Lost in your mind
I wanna know
Am I losing my mind?
Never let me go

[Hook: Noonie Bao]
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

[Verse 2: Noonie Bao]
Unconscious mind
I'm wide awake
Wanna feel one last time
Take my pain away

[Hook: Noonie Bao]
If this night is not forever
At least we are together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
Anywhere, whenever
Apart, but still together
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone
I know I'm not alone

LYRICS:
Into these eyes
i'm falling
but can explain

This all in
my body aches
for this moment there's no controllin'
why does it feel like home
like i've known you all alone
I don't know what's going on
between us why does it feel like home
when I think I don't belong
that's when you come alone
and take me...
Why does it feel like home?...
Why does it feel like home?.
Why does it feel like home?...
Like i've known you all alone.
Why does it feel like home?...
and here before know what it feels like.
this can't be wrong.
somehow it feels right.
i'm not alone, but out of my mind you make the greater lie.
Why does it feel like home?.
Like i've known you all alone, I don't know what's going on between us.
Why does it feel like home when I think I don't belong that's when you come along and take me.
Why does it feel like home?.
Why does it feel like home?...
Why does it feel like home like i've known you all along.
Why does it feel like home?.
Why does it feel like home?.

Going through frustration

All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (Daily struggle)

LYRICS:
Are we crazy?
Living our lives through a lens
Trapped in our white picket fence
Like ornaments
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, a bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble
Aren't you lonely
Up there in utopia
Where nothing will ever be enough?
Happily numb
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, a bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Are we tone deaf?
Keep sweeping it under the mat
Thought we could do better than that
I hope we can
So comfortable, we're living in a bubble, a bubble
So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble

So put your rose-colored glasses on
And party on

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm
Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

It is my desire
Break down the walls to connect, inspire
Ay, up in your high place, liars
Time is ticking for the empire
The truth they feed is feeble
As so many times before
They greed over the people
They stumbling and fumbling
And we're about to riot
They woke up, they woke up the lions
(Woo!)

Turn it up, it's your favorite song
Dance, dance, dance to the distortion
Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat
Stumbling around like a wasted zombie
Yeah, we think we're free
Drink, this one is on me
We're all chained to the rhythm
To the rhythm
To the rhythm

Turn it up
Turn it up
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
It goes on, and on, and on
'Cause we're all chained to the rhythm

[Verse 1]
We said goodbye
That's what you told me once
So many times we've made our peace
But this is love, I'll never give you up
But now your love has come home to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a river, always running
I keep losing you
Like a fire, always burning
I'll be here for you

[Chorus]
If you're ready, I'll deserve you
I'll be waiting, come find me
If you're certain for forever
I'll be waiting, come find me
I can see you, you're in the darkness
Finding life right where your heart is
If you're ready, I'll deserve you
I'll be waiting, come find me

[Post-Chorus]
Come find me
Come find me
I can see you, you're in the darkness
Finding life right where your heart is
If you're ready, I'll deserve you
I'll be waiting, come find me

[Verse 2]
If your star waits
That's what you told me once
But tears they come and go
This is us, I'll never get enough
It's taking losing you to know

[Chorus]
If you're ready, I'll deserve you
I'll be waiting, come find me
If you're certain for forever
I'll be waiting, come find me
I can see you, you're in the darkness
Finding life right where your heart is
If you're ready (if you're ready)
I'll deserve you (I'll deserve you)
I'll be waiting, come find me

Come find me

I want to meet but never leave now

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How
Could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else”

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town
On our own cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past we were livin' in

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are
Let's show them we are

Let's show them we are better

It's raining, it's pouring
My lovelife is boring me to tears
After all these years

No sunshine, no moonlight
No stardust, no sign of romance
We don't stand a chance

I've always dreamed I 'd find the perfect lover
But he turned out to be like every other man
Our love, our love

Raining (raining)
Pouring (pouring)
There's nothing left for us here
And we won't waist another tear

If you've had enough
Don't put up with his stuff
Don't you do it
If you've had your fill
Get the check pay the bill
You can do it

Tell him to just get out
Nothing left to talk about
Pack his raincoat show him out
Just look him in the eyes and simple shout

Enough is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
Enough is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover
But he turns out to be like every other man
Our love (I had no choice from the start)
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
Our love (tearing us apart)

Enough, is enough, is enough
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
Enough, is enough, is enough
I want him out, I want him out that door now

Goodbye mister, goodbye
Goodbye mister, goodbye sugar

No more tears
No more tears
No more tears

You go where the wind blows
Destroying everyone in your path
I'm done feeding your ego
Forgetting everything that we had

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Verse 2]
Good luck when you wake up
And realize all that you lost
Shiny lies are what you're made of
I hope it's worth the price that it cost

[Pre-Chorus]
Funny how history ends in an instant
How something so close can end up so distant

[Chorus]
Dancing on the line of the great divide
Wash my hands, turn my back
I don't need the memories we had
I'm leaving you behind
Across the great divide

[Bridge]
I let you go, so let me go
Let us go
I let you, I let you, I let you go

Yeah, uh

Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
'Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

You are not the single type
So baby, this the perfect time
I'm just trying to get you high
And faded off this touch
You don't need a lonely night
So baby, I can make it right
You just got to let me try
To give you what you want

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me

I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I know what you feel right now
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I know what you say right now, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I know what you say right now, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, babe

I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, babe
I feel it coming, babe

LYRICS:
So i betcha
the sun will rise & i'd find you
even though you didnt promise what you said you were gonna do

so i betcha,i betcha, i betcha
you'd find your way back to me
when you run out of every tall tale & any fool who believe ya
i betcha, i betcha, i betcha

you'll be sitting on the fence, waiting for the chance to love somebody
but nobody's coming for you
you're the centre of your universe
wrapped up in yourself
so who's waiting for you

so i betcha that you're gonna want me in the middle of the night when you're sleeping so tight oh oh
so i betcha that you're gonna need me when the rain comes down & then suddenly like a big catfight
so go oh oh and say whatcha say
cos i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya
yeah i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya

so i betcha you'll be thinking about me when it's 2am and you're falling all over yourself
and i betcha you'll remember those nights
those crazy crazy nights
so act the way you want
cos i dont need to flaunt
cos i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya
yeah i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya

i keep forgetting the way we were
was all so cold
you never give me more than i needed you to
it's a lesson, my confession, you get me guessing
so i understand we went our separate ways
you cheated, i retreated
but i forgave

so i betcha that you're gonna want me in the middle of the night when you're sleeping so tight oh oh
so i betcha that you're gonna need me when the rain comes down & then suddenly like a big catfight
so go oh oh and say whatcha say
cos i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya
yeah i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya

(oh~ oh~ nothing~ oh~ oh~)

(so i betcha that you're gonna need me when the rain comes down & then suddenly like a big catfight)
(so go oh oh and say whatcha say)
(cos i betcha you'll be thinking about me ya)

You’re all over me, can’t deny it
You make the room come alive
You know the problem with you
You’re too good to be true
You’re my heart
I can’t get enough
You are the one I decided

You’re my fun
When I’m down
You pick me up again
You pick me up again
You’re my fun, too much fun
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind

Take me back home again
I wanna make love again
Take me back home again
Ooh yeah yeah
You’re my fun
Too much fun
Isn’t fun

The deafening sound of a heartbeat
You’re smiling at me, not with your eyes
You know the problem with you
You’re too good to be true
You’re my heart
I can’t get enough
Time after time, you’re on time
I get the feeling that you’re making me blind

You're my fun
When I’m down
You pick me up again
You pick me up again
You’re my fun, too much fun
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind

Take me back home again
I wanna make love again
Take me back home again
Ooh yeah yeah
You’re my fun
Too much fun
Isn’t fun

You know the problem with you
You’re too good to be true
You’re my heart
I can’t get enough
And time after time, you’re on time
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind

You’re my fun
When I’m down
You pick me up again
You pick me up again
You’re my fun, too much fun
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind
I get the feeling that you’re making me blind
I get the feeling that you’re making me blind

You’re my fun
When I’m down
You pick me up again
You pick me up again
You’re my fun, too much fun
I get the feeling that you’re changing my mind

Take me back home again
I wanna make love again
Take me back home again
Ooh yeah yeah
You’re my fun
Too much fun
Isn’t fun

[Intro]
Ay baby, hey baby
Ay baby, hey baby

[Verse 1]
You want it all
All alone, walking high on the wire
You want it all
Or you brag that you're lost in the fire
Before you fall
Let me show you me love that you know you've been searching for
You've been searching for
Now you got me saying
[Chorus]
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine

[Verse 2]
I see it all
You could run, you could hide if you like
I see it all
See you lost all the light in your eyes
I'm standing tall
Let me show you me love that you know you've been looking for
What you waiting for
Now you got me saying

[Chorus]
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine

[Chorus]
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine
Hey baby, it'll all be fine
Take a deep breath let me blow your mind
Hey baby, leave it all behind
Show me your love and I'll show you mine

LYRICS:
I was tired of choking
So I took your noose off my neck
I got bored of lying face down
So I wouldn't have to see you
I got sick of crawling
So you could be a big man
I got tired of my balls being cut off
'Cause you didn't have none
You had a good run yeah didn't ya babe?
Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust

So long live love
I ain't ever given up on it
Long live love
Won't be long until I rise up
Long live love
I ain't ever given up on it
Long live love
Won't be long until I rise up
And I'll rise up
So long live love

Gonna wash your dirt off
'Til I'm spankin' clean
'Cause the real deal baby
He's gonna look good on me
I forgive myself
For all the time I wasted on you
If I learned anything baby I learned
What a man ain't to do
You had a good run yeah didn't ya babe?
Now it's ashes to ashes and dust to dust

So long live love
I ain't ever given up on it
Long live love
Won't be long until I rise up
Long live love
I ain't ever given up on it
Long live love
Won't be long until I rise up
And I'll rise up
So long live love

Light
We need some light
First of all we need some light

You can sit here in the dark
And all alone it's a sorry side

It's just you and me
We'll live you'll see
Night after night
We sit and wait for the morning light
But we've waited far too long
For all that's wrong to be made right
Day after day wishing all our cares away
Trying to find the things we feel
But some hearts never heal
Some ghost are never gone
But we go on
We still go on

And you find some way to survive
And you find out you don't have to be happy at all
To be happy your a light

Day after day
Give me clouds and rain and gray
Give me pain if that's what's real
It's the price we pay that's real
The price of love is lost
But still we pay
We love anyways

And when the night has finally gone
And when we see the new day dawn
We wonder how we wander for so long so blind
The wasted world we thought we knew
The light will make it look brand new
So let it
Let it, Let it, Let it, Shine, Shine, Shiiine
Day after day, we will find the will to find our way
No we met the darkest night
We'll someday see the sun
When not long, night is done
There will be light
There will be light
When we open up our lives
Sons and daughters husbands wife's s
And fight that fight
There will be light
There will be light
There will be light

There will be light
