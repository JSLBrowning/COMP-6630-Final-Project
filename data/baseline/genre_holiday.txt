LYRICS:
Well, it's getting late, we better start heading home now
Baby Bop, will you turn off the lights as we leave?

Turn on the lights?
Turn off the lights
Turn on the lights?

Oy, oy, oy, sissy
Barney said, "Turn off the lights"
That's the opposite of 'On'
What's an opposite?

Bouncing a ball, bouncing a ball
What does it do? Let's see
It goes up, down, up, down
That sounds like an opposite to me!

There is a door, there is a door
What does it do? Let's see
It goes open, close, open, close
That sounds like an opposite to me!

If it does one thing
And then it does the other
It could be opposite
As we have discovered

I hear a voice, I hear a voice
What will it do? Let's see
It sings high, low, high, low
Hmm, that sounds like an opposite to me!

Let's take a breath, let's take a breath
What do we do? Let's see
We breathe in, out, in, out
Well, that sounds like an opposite to me!

If it does one thing
And then it does the other
It could be opposite
As we have discovered

Do you wanna try, Baby Bop?
Well, okay, Barney

There is a light, there is a light
What does it do? Let's see
Ooh, it goes on, off, on, off
Hmm, that sounds like an opposite to me!
Yeah, that sounds like an opposite to me!

LYRICS:
Never talk to strangers, that's very good advise
'Cause you just can't tell if they are good or bad
Even though they may seem nice
Even though they may seem nice

Don't get in their car, don't take anything from them
Just turn around and walk away
Go back and tell a grown up friend
Go back and tell a grown up friend

Never talk to strangers, that's very good advise
'Cause you just can't tell if they are good or bad
Even though they may seem nice
Even though they may seem nice

Don't get in their car, don't take anything from them
Just turn around and walk away
Go back and tell a grown up friend
Go back and tell a grown up friend

Don't get in their car, don't take anything from them
Just turn around and walk away
Go back and tell a grown up friend
Go back and tell a grown up friend
Go back and tell a grown up friend

LYRICS:
Oh I like red it's the color of an apple
Orange it's the color of an orange
Yellow its a lemon and a wonderful sun, sun, sun

Green its the color of the trees and lots of things that grow
And then there's blue for the sky
And purple that's a color that's fun, fun, fun

And when you put those colors side by side
Now what do you think we've done
We've made a rainbow
And it's a really beautiful one, one, one

Oh I like red it's the color of an apple
Orange it's the color of an orange
Yellow its a lemon and a wonderful sun, sun, sun
And my favorite

Green its the color of the trees and lots of things that grow
And then there's blue for the sky
And purple that's a color that's fun, fun, fun

And when you put those colors side by side
Now what do you think we've done
We've made a rainbow
Oh, we've made a rainbow
We've made a rainbow
And it's a really beautiful one

LYRICS:
Now it's time snuggle up, little one
Hold me tight snuggle up, day is done

It's bedtime with Barney
All over the world
Bedtime with Barney
For all boys and girls

Now it's time snuggle up, little one
Let me sing just for you, you're the one

It's bedtime with Barney
The near and the far
Bedtime with Barney
Let's wish on a star

We laughed, we played
All day was fun
We jumped, we ran
Now day is done

Now it's time to get our rest, little one
Snuggle in your little nest, night has come

It's bedtime with Barney
So let's close our eyes
Together with Barney
We'll sing lullaby

LYRICS:
Wynken, Blynken and Nod one night
Sailed off in a wooden shoe
Sailed on a river of crystal light
Into a sea of dew

"Where are you going, what do you wish?"
The old moon asked the three
"We have come to fish for the herring fish
That live in this beautiful sea
Oh, nets of silver and gold have we"
Said Wynken, Blynken and Nod

The old moon laughed and he sang a song
And they rocked in the wooden shoe
And the wind that sped them all night long
Ruffled the waves of dew

The little stars were the herring fish
That lived in that beautiful sea
"Now cast your nets wherever you wish
For never feared are we"
So cried the stars too the fishermen three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

All night long their nets they threw
To the star and the twinkling foam
Then down from the skies came the wooden shoe
Bringing the fishermen home

'Twas all so pretty a sail it seemed
As if it could not be
And some folks thought 'twas a dream they dreamed
Of sailing that beautiful sea
But I shall name you the fishermen three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

Wynken and Blynken are two little eyes
And Nod is a little head
And the wooden shoe that sailed the skies
Is a wee one's trundle bed

So shut your eyes while mother sings
Of wonderful sights that be
And you shall see the beautiful things
As you rock on the misty sea
Where the old shoe rocked the fishermen three
Wynken, Blynken and Nod

LYRICS:
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
For the flowers and the trees,
And the fishes in the seas,
The raindrops drop all around.
Helping rivers flow and your garden grow,
As they fall from the sky to the ground.
When the rain goes ker-plop,
All the animals stop
At a pool for a nice cool drink.
They are just like you,
They get thirsty too.
But you get your water from a sink.
And the rain can make a puddle,
So the birds can splash all around.
Taking a bath and chirping away,
Singing happily to the raindrops,
When they make this sound:
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
When the sun goes away
And the clouds turn gray
And the rain ker-plops in your eyes.
If it makes you sad,
You will soon be glad.
Look down and you'll see a fun surprise.
For the rain can make a puddle,
So the birds can splash all around.
Taking a bath and chirping away,
Singing happily to the raindrops,
When they make this sound:
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
Ker-plink! Ker-plop!
In those puddles, I love to hop!
I don't care if it never stops!
How I love the raindrops!

Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree
Merry, merry king of the bush is he
Laugh kookaburra, laugh
Kookaburra, gay your life must be

Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree
Eating all the gumdrops that he can see
Stop, kookaburra, stop
Kookaburra, leave some there for me

Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree
Chasing all the monkeys he can see
Stop, kookaburra, stop
leave them their for me

Tell, me, tell me where's the life we planned?
Where are the dreams that we were dreaming o-o-of?

LYRICS:
Sometimes we're real close friends
We stay up late and talk at night
Other times we don't get along
There are even times we fight

But I know she's always there
And I know she'll always care
She's my sister, I love my sister

I've given her a great big hug
When she was feeling sad
But then again I've said somethings
That have really made her mad

But I know she's always there
And I know she'll always care
She's my sister, I love my sister

But I know she's always there
And I know she'll always care
She's my sister, I love my sister
She's my sister, I love my sister

LYRICS:
You can have an adventure in a far away land
You can learn about a tuba in a marching band
You can travel to the stars, or the deep blue sea
When you learn to borrow books from the library

But please don't be loud shh, so that everyone here can read
You will be proud when you take a book home from the library

You can have an adventure in a far away land
You can learn about a tuba in a marching band
You can travel to the stars, or the deep blue sea
When you learn to borrow books from the library

But please don't be loud shh, so that everyone here can read
You will be proud when you take a book home from the library

LYRICS:
I broke my bat on Johnny's head
Somebody snitched on me
I hid a frog in sister's bed
Somebody snitched on me

I spilled some ink on Mommy's rug
I made Tommy eat a bug
Bought some gum with a penny slug
Somebody snitched on me, oh

I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad

I put a tack on teacher's chair
Somebody snitched on me
I tied a knot in Susie's hair
Somebody snitched on me

I did a dance on Mommy's plants
Climbed a tree and tore my pants
Filled the sugar bowl with ants
Somebody snitched on me, so

I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad

I won't be seeing Santa Claus
Somebody snitched on me
He won't come visit me because
Somebody snitched on me

Next year I'll be going straight
Next year I'll be good, just wait
I'd start now but it's too late
Somebody snitched on me, oh

I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
Mommy and Daddy are mad
I'm gettin' nuttin' for Christmas
'Cause I ain't been nuttin' but bad

So you better be good
Whatever you do
'Cause if you're bad I'm warning you
You'll get nuttin' for Christmas

Me and my best teddy bear, sitting in my favorite chair
We are going out to play just like every day
I got lots of friends out there and they're lots of fun
But they're not my teddy bear, he's my favorite one

Me and my teddy, getting all ready
Getting all ready to play
Me and my teddy, getting all ready
Getting all ready to play

You know I've got a lot of friends that I play with
You know I've got a lot of friends who are fun
But then they can't do everything what my teddy
'Cause my teddy, he is the one

Me and my teddy, getting all ready
Getting all ready for bed
Me and my teddy, getting all ready
Getting all ready for bed

You know I never really fright to get night time
You know I'm not even scared of the dark
'Cause with my teddy right here alongside me
I'm not even scared of a shark

Me and my teddy, getting all ready
Getting all ready for school
Me and my teddy, getting all ready
Getting all ready for school

I've got to leave him at home by himself all alone
But he doesn't mind it and that's cool, that's cool

Early in the morning when I get dressed
Because I always want to look my best
The first thing I do, so everyone will see
Is put a great big smile on me

I put a smile on
A smile on my face
I put a smile on
I wear it every place

I put a smile on
And soon I see
The whole world's
Smiling back at me

A smile is pretty, a smile is free
A smile is a gift to you from me
A smile is a present in a special way
'Cause you still get to keep it when you give it away

I put a smile on

We could go to the moon in a great big boat
Build a castle by playing 'Pretend'
We might even explore with the big dinosaur
Or make rainbows that never end

Just imagine, just imagine
Just imagine all the things that we could be
Imagine all the places we could go and see
Imagination's fun for you and me

We can go anywhere, we can be anyone
We can do it quite easily too
We just play 'Let's Pretend'
And we know in the end that it's so much fun to do
