TITLE: Love Potion No. 9 Lyrics
LYRICS:
I took my troubles down to Madame Ruth
You know that gypsy with the gold-capped tooth
She's got a pad down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
Sellin' little bottles of Love Potion Number Nine

I told her that I was a flop with chics
I've been this way since 1956
She looked at my palm and she made a magic sign
She said "What you need is Love Potion Number Nine"

She bent down and turned around and gave me a wink
She said "I'm gonna make it up right here in the sink"
It smelled like turpentine, it looked like Indian ink
I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine

I held my nose, I closed my eyes, I took a drink

I didn't know if it was day or night
I started kissin' everything in sight
But when I kissed a cop down on Thirty-Fourth and Vine
He broke my little bottle of Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine
Love Potion Number Nine

Águas De MarÇo
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um caco de vidro, é a vida é o sol
É a noite, é a morte, é um laço, é o anzol
É peroba do campo, é o nó da madeira
Caingá Candeia, é o Matita Pereira
É madeira de vento, tombo da ribanceira
É o mistério profundo, é o queira ou não queira
É o vento ventando, é o fim da ladeira,
É a viga, é o vão, festa da cumeeira
É a chuva chovendo, é a conversa ribeira
Das águas de março, é o fim da canseira
É o pé, é o chão, é a marcha estradeira,
Passarinho na mão, pedra de atiradeira
É a ave no céu, é uma ave no chão,
É um regato, é uma fonte, é um pedaço de pão
É o fundo do poço, é o fim do caminho
No rosto o desgosto, é um pouco sozinho
É um estrepe, é um prego, é uma conta, é um conto
É um pingo pingando, é uma conta, é um ponto
É um peixe, é um gesto, é uma prata brilhando
É a luz da manhã, é o tijolo chegando
É a lenha, é o dia, é o fim da picada
É a garrafa de cana, o estilhaço na estrada
É o projeto da casa, é o corpo na cama
É o carro enguiçado, é a lama, é a lama
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um resto de mato, na luz da manhã
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É uma cobra, é um pau,é João, é José
É um espinho na mão, é um corte no pé
São as águas de março fechando o verão
É a promessa de vida no teu coração
É pau, é pedra, é o fim do caminho
É um resto de toco, é um pouco sozinho
É um passo, é uma ponte, é um sapo, é uma rã
É um belo horizonte, é a febre terçã.

The Unicorn
The Unicorn
A long time ago, when the earth was green,
There were more kinds of animals than you've ever seen.
They'd run around free while the earth was being born.
And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.

There were green alligators and long-necked geese.
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as you're born.
And the loveliest of them all was the unicorn.

Now, God saw some sinning, and it gave him pain.
So he said, "Stand back, I'm going to make it rain."
He said, "Hey, Brother Noah, I'll tell you what to do:
Build me a floating zoo.

And take some of them green alligators and long-necked geese.
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, as sure as you're born.
And don't you forget my unicorn."

Old Noah was there to answer the call.
He finished up making the Ark just as the rain started falling.
He marched in the animals two by two,
And he called out as they went through,

"Hey Lord, I got your green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephants, but Lord, I'm so forlorn.
I just can't see no unicorn."

Then Noah looked out through the driving rain.
Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games.
Kicking and splashing while the rain was pourin'.
Oh them silly unicorn!

There were green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Noah cried, "Close the door, cause the rain is pourin'
And we just can't wait for no unicorn."

The Ark started moving, it drifted with the tide.
The unicorns looked up from the rocks, and they cried.
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away.
And that's why you've never seen a unicorn, to this very day.

You'll see green alligators and long-necked geese,
Some humpy-backed camels and some chimpanzees.
Some cats and rats and elephant, but sure as you're born,
You're never gonna see no unicorn.

C'est etrange
Je n'sais pas ce qui m'arrive ce soir
Je te regarde comme pour la premiere fois
Encore des mots toujours des mots
Les memes mots

Je n'sais plus comme te dire
Rien que des mots
Mais tu es cette belle histoire d'amour
Que je ne cesserai jamais de lire

Des mots faciles des mots fragiles
C'etait trop beau
Tu es d'hier et de demain
Bien trop beau

De toujours ma seule verite
Mais c'est fini le temps des reves
Les souvenirs se fanent aussi
Quand on les oublie

Tu es comme le vent qui fait chanter les violons
Et emporte au loin le parfum des roses
Caramels, bonbons et chocolats
Par moments, je ne te comprends pas

Merci, pas pour moi
Mais tu peux bien les offrir a une autre
Qui aime le vent et le parfum des roses
Moi, les mots tendres enrobes de douceur

Se posent sur ma bouche
Mais jamais sur mon coeur
Une parole encore
Parole, parole, parole
Ecoute-moi

Parole, parole, parole

Parole, parole, parole

Voila mon destin te parler
Te parler comme la premiere fois
Encore des mots toujours des mots

Les memes mots
Comme j'aimerais que tu me comprennes
Rien que des mots
Que tu m'ecoutes au moins une fois

Des mots magiques des mots tactiques
Qui sonnent faux
Tu es mon reve defendu
Oui, tellement faux

Mon seul tourment et mon unique esperance
Rien ne t'arrete quand tu commences
Si tu savais comme j'ai envie
D'un peu de silence

Tu es pour moi la seule musique
Qui fit danser les etoiles sur les dunes
Caramels, bonbons et chocolats
Si tu n'existais pas deja je t'inventerais

Merci, pas pour moi
Mais tu peux bien les ouvrir a une autre
Qui aime les etoiles sur les dunes
Moi, les mots tendres enrobes de douceur

Se posent sur ma bouche
Mais jamais sur mon coeur
Encore un mot juste une parole

Of all the money that e'er I had

To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be to you all

So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate'er befalls
Then gently rise and softly call
"Good night and joy be to you all"

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay

But since it fell into my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and softly call
"Good night and joy be to you all"

But since it fell into my lot
That I should rise and you should not

Could've been the whiskey
Might've been the gin
Could've been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in

My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party?

Someone took a grapefruit
Wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talking to my old tom cat

They were talking about hockey
The cat was talking back
Long about then every-thing went black
Wasn't that a party?

I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Cutting down my neighbor's tree

Could've been the whiskey
Might've been the gin
Could've been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in

My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party?

Billy, Joe and Tommy
Well they went a little far
They were sittin' in the back seat, blowing on a siren
From somebody's police car

So you see, your honor
It was all in fun
The little bitty track meet down on main street
Was just to see if the cops could run

Well they run us in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
I sure can use those thirty days
To recover from the party

Could've been the whiskey
Might've been the gin
Could've been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in

My head is like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me oh, me oh my
Wasn't that a party?

Janji terikat setia
Masa mengupas segala
Mungkin dia kan berlalu

Farewell to Nova Scotia, the sea-bound coast,
Let your mountains dark and dreary be
When I’m far away, on the briny ocean tossed,
Will you ever heave a sigh or a wish for me?

The sun was setting in the West
The birds were singing on every tree
All nature seemed to be at rest
But, alas, there was no rest for me.

[chorus]

I grieve to leave my native home
I grieve to leave my comrades all
And my parents whom I hold so dear
And the bonny, bonny lass that I do adore.

[chorus]

The drums do beat and the horns do alarm
My captain calls; I must obey
Farewell, farewell, to Nova Scotia’s charm
For it’s early in the morning I am bound far away

[chorus]

I have two brothers and they are at rest.
Their hands are folded on their chest.
But a poor and simple sailor just like me
Must be tossed and turned on the deep, dark sea.

Black Velvet Band
Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds.
You'd think she was queen of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders,
Tied up with a black velvet band.

In a neat little town they call Belfast, apprentice to trade I was bound.
And many an hour of sweet happiness I spent in that neat little town.
But bad misfortune came o'er me, and caused me to stray from the land
Far away from my friends and relations. They follow the black velvet band.

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds.
You'd think she was queen of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders,
Tied up with a black velvet band.

Well,  I went out strolling one evening, not meaning to go very far,
When I met with a frolicksome damsel. She was selling her trade in the bar.
A watch she took from a customer, and slipped it right into my hand.
Then the law came and put me in prison.
Bad luck to her black velvet band!

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds.
You'd think she was queen of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders,
Tied up with a black velvet band.

Next morning, before judge and jury, for trial I had to appear.
And the judge, he said "my young fellow, the case against you is quite clear.
And seven long years is your sentence. You're going to Van Diemen's Land,
Far away from your friends and relations. They follow the black velvet band."

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds.
You'd think she was queen of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders,
Tied up with a black velvet band.

Now, come all ye jolly young fellows, I'll have you take warning by me.
And whenever you're out on the liquor, my lads, beware of the pretty colleens.
For they'll fill you with whiskey and porter, til you are not able to stand.
And the very next thing that you know, my lads, you've landed in Van Diemen's
Land.

Her eyes, they shone like the diamonds.
You'd think she was queen of the land,
And her hair hung over her shoulders,
Tied up with a black velvet band.

A little bit gory 
A little bit happy 
A little bit sad 
Of Lily the pink and 
Her medicinal compounds. 
And how it drove her to the bad. 

Ol' Ebenezer
Thought he was Julius Ceasar
So they put him in the home.
There they gave him medicinal compound,
Now he's Emperor of Rome.

Freddy Klinger. 
The opera singer 
Could break a glass with his voice 
'Tis said. 
Rubbed his tonsils 
With medicinal compounds 
Now they break glasses over his head. 

Johnny Hammer 
Had a t-t-terrible stammer. 
He could hardly s-s-say a word. 
So they g-g-gave him 
Medicinal compounds. 
Now he's s-s-seen 
But never heard. 

(Chorus) 

Uncle Paul, he 
Was very small, he 
Was the shortest man in town. 
Rubbed his body 
With medicinal compounds. 
Now he weighs only half a pound. 

Lily died and 
Went up to heaven. 
All the church bells 
They did ring. 
She took with her 
Medicinal compounds. 
Hark the herald angels sing.

TITLE: Leader Of The Band Lyrics
LYRICS:
An only child alone and wild
A cabinet maker's son
His hands were meant for different work
And his heart was known to none --
He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
And he gave to me a gift I know 
I never can repay

A quiet man of music
Denied a simpler fate
He tried to be a soldier once
But his music wouldn't wait
He earned his love through discipline
A thundering, velvet hand
His gentle means of sculpting souls
Took me years to understand.

The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band.

My brothers' lives were different
For they heard another call
One went to Chicago
And the other to St. Paul
And I'm in Colorado
When I'm not in some hotel
Living out this life I've chose
And come to know so well.

(Instrumental)

I thank you for the music
And your stories of the road
I thank you for the freedom when it came my time to go --
I thank you for the kindness
And the times when you got tough
And, papa, I don't think I
Said 'I love you' near enough --

The leader of the band is tired
And his eyes are growing old
But his blood runs through my instrument
And his song is in my soul --
My life has been a poor attempt
To imitate the man
I'm just a living legacy
To the leader of the band
I am the living legacy
To the leader of the band.

Standing there alone, the ship is waiting
All systems are go, are you sure?
Control is not convinced
But the computer has the evidence
No need to abort

The countdown starts, watching in a trance
The crew is certain

Nothing left to chance, all is working
Trying to relax, up in the capsule
"Send me up a drink", jokes Major Tom
The count goes on

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us, drifting falling
Floating weightless, calling calling home

Second stage is cut, we're now in orbit
Stabilizers up, running perfect
Starting to collect, requested data
What will it effect, when all is done
Thinks Major Tom

Back at ground control, there is a problem
Go to rockets full, not responding
Hello Major Tom, are you receiving
Turn the thrusters on, we're standing by
There's no reply

4, 3, 2, 1
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, calling, calling, home

Across the stratosphere
A final message, "Give my wife my love"
Then nothing more

Far beneath the ship, the world is mourning
They don't realize, he's alive
No one understands but Major Tom sees
Now the life commands, this is my home
I'm coming home

Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming home
Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming home

Earth below us, drifting, falling
Floating, weightless, coming, coming home
