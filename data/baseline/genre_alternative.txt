TITLE: Dragon Tales Theme Song Lyrics
LYRICS:
Emmy wished on a dragon scale
And that's what started Dragon Tales
Around the room the dragons flew
But Emmy and Max knew what to do
They climbed on the backs of their dragon friends
Now the adventures never end!

Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales
it's almost time for Dragon Tales
Come along and take my hand
Let's all go to Dragon Land

There's Ord, he's the biggest
Not so brave of heart
There's Cassie
So shy, but so very smart
There's Zak and Wheezie and the tales of fun
Cause you know two heads are better than one

Dragon Tales, Dragon Tales
It's almost time for Dragon Tales
Come along and take my hand
Let's all go to Dragon Land

TITLE: Almost Lover Lyrics
LYRICS:
Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind, images
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes, clever trick

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?

So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me in the shade
And when you left you kissed my lips
You told me you would never ever forget these images, no

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?

So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot try the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind

So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life?

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Why can't you just let me be?

So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

TITLE: Blow Away Lyrics
LYRICS:
One of us is gonna be here and
And one of us is gonna be runnin'
Off alone into a great unknown

You're not me, you're a model of freedom
All you need are your kicks when you need 'em
Come and go, caught that slow alright

With one hand off the side
We get farther away in the blink of an eye

And it's the time we waste swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow away

Hey you, yeah, you gotta be leavin'
Say what you want, what you say, say anythin'
No one knows just how deep it goes

We are old in your teenaged tyranny
And all you need is a hunger to feed
I've got my own secrets though, say what?

With a heart full of mess and lore
We are doomed but we wanted more

It's the ride we take, the many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow away
And we blow away

One of us is now retreatin', you knocked me down
So hard I'm seein' a thousand stars
Come out where you are

'Cause I won't never be caught cryin'
And I will not be taken lyin' down
It blows into smoke

The time we waste swallowed into space
It's the time it takes to blow
It's the ride we take, the many winged escape
It's the bough we break to blow

It's the times we say
That no one's gonna take your place
It's a mistake to blow away, we blow away

TITLE: Ang Huling El Bimbo Lyrics
LYRICS:
Kamukha mo si Paraluman 
Nung tayo ay bata pa
At ang galing galing mong sumayaw 
Mapa boogie man o cha cha
Ngunit ang paborito
Ay ang pagsayaw mo ng El Bimbo
Nakakaindak, nakakaaliw
Nakakatindig balahibo
Pagkaggaling sa eskwela
Ay dideretso na sa inyo
At buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako

Magkahawak ang ating kamay 
At walang kamalaymalay
Na tinuruan mo ang puso ko 
Na umibig ng tunay
Naninigas ang aking katawan
Kapag umikot na ang plaka
Patay sa kembot ng beywang mo
At pungay ng yong mga mata
Lumiliwanag ang buhay
Habang tayo'y magkaakbay
At dahang dahang dumudulas
Ang kamay ko sa makinis kong braso
Sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa inyo
At kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko
At lumipas ang maraming taon
Hindi na tayo nagkita
Balita ko'y may anak ka na
Ngunit walang asawa
Tagahugas ka raw ng pinggan sa may Ermita
At isang gabi'y nasagasaan sa isang madilim na eskenita
Lahat ng pangarap ko'y bigla lang natunaw 
Sa panaginip na lang pala kita maisasayaw

TITLE: Dealbreaker Lyrics
LYRICS:
I found that record you'd been looking for yesterday
The one I'd been searching for forever

I played that record all night, you were right
The last song said it all
Even though it skipped a bit, it sounded better

I never, I never, I never knew
The only way to listen to a record like that
Is to play it through

But all of this means nothing
Yeah, all of this means nothing
All of this means nothing
Without you

I packed up the car and started to drive
Without a plan, with no direction

You said it'd be good for me
To break out of my daily routine
You were always trying to teach some lesson

You wanted, you wanted, you wanted me
To feel the open road with the wind on my face
Well, I'm here and I'm finally free

But all of this means nothing
Yeah, all of this means nothing
All of this means nothing
Without you

You and I were partners in crime
Petty thieves in a line up
But somehow we wound up here

I'm looking at a letter that I wrote to you long ago
I wouldn't even know now where to send it
It's funny how it all poured out on paper
If only I had found a way to tell you

If only, if only, if only you
Had found a way to love me for who I am
The way that I loved you

But all of this means nothing
Yeah, all of this means nothing
All of this means nothing
Without, without, without, without, without you

TITLE: Diamonds And Waste Lyrics
LYRICS:
Is it your name?
I held it up to the light and the rain
You're so real, I feel every grain
Of pleasure and pain

It is your presence?
It takes over the mountains and deserts
They're never lost in the summer 
And it's 'cause you are the vital part

What a start

We are a pack of cards
I may be ace, but you're the king
The king of everything
Look what you win
We are a pack of cards
I may be ace, but you're the king
The king of everything
Look what you win

Is it your traits?
You know that anyone will bite the bait
'Cause they're all wanting more and more of the taste
Of your diamonds and waste

What a waste


We are a pack of cards
I may be ace, but you're the king
The king of everything
Look what you win
We are a pack of cards
I may be ace, but you're the king
The king of everything
Look what you win

And does it feel really good to know that you're understood
And does it feel really good to know you would if you could


We are a pack of cards
I may be ace, but you're the king
The king of everything
Look what you win
We are a pack of cards
I may be ace, but you're the king
The king of everything
Look what you win

TITLE: Pull My Heart Away Lyrics
LYRICS:
I'm ripping your posters off the wall
I'm moving the boxes into the hall
I stop when I hear a drumbeat call
Must be a sign, it is time

I need to take myself away
From the pillowed hand on which I stand
And throw me out of the side of a plane
And I'll just see where I land

I will have to pull my heart away
'Cause if I never leave I'll ruin yesterday

It's not like my feet are stuck to the floor
It's not like I'm wanting to know about the door
I want you to throw my shoes in the fire
And I'll watch the souls burn on the funeral pyre

And I'm over and it will change my position
And I'll know that nobody, nobody's listening
And that's easy for me and it's better for the soul
And it's better for you and it's better for all

I will have to pull my heart away
'Cause if I never leave I'll ruin yesterday
I will have to pull my heart away
'Cause if I never leave I'll ruin yesterday

I'm over with words, I'm moving in lines
And all that I put is jump up inside, jump off the side

I will have to pull my heart away
'Cause if I never leave I'll ruin yesterday
I will have to pull my heart away
'Cause if I never leave I'll ruin yesterday

I will have to pull my heart away

TITLE: Replaced Lyrics
LYRICS:
It's like your eyes are vicious spies
They're in disguise as a supermassive black hole
And I unfold
It's like your touch is just too much for my skin to deal with
And so it shields itself

With all this power under your belt
You knowingly mocked the way I felt

And now I know what it feels like
In the corner of your narrow mind
One hundred weeks later I find
He's been replaced with
A soul that knows too much
A heart that's out of touch
Oh, yes, you've hit the right nerve

You take your words, you make them heard
So loud I can't speak
And now I think I know why I never wanted to
You take my hand
Make sure each grain of sand has disappeared with you

You know I used to know you well
I'm staring at the spot you fell

And now I know what it feels like
In the corner of your narrow mind
One hundred weeks later I find
He's been replaced with
A soul that knows too much
A heart that's out of touch
Oh, yes, you've hit the right nerve

You wanna love, you wanna
You wanna love but you've forgotten how
You wanna love, you wanna
You wanna love but you don't love me now

You wanna love, you wanna
You wanna love but you've forgotten how
You wanna love, you wanna
You wanna love but you don't love me now

Now I know what it feels like
In the corner of your narrow mind
One hundred weeks later I find
He's been replaced with
A soul that knows too much
A heart that's out of touch

You wanna love, you wanna
You wanna love but you've forgotten how
You wanna love, you wanna
You wanna love but you don't love me now

Baby, I've been missing you in the strongest place
All other days of the week have come down to this
Just kiss me, we'll be okay

There's no one around here that I would miss
Mad, if you were away

It's a little, it's a little luck, it's a little so oh, oh, oh, what
It's a little, it's a little love, it's a little love for what we've got
It's another day to start making up
Oh baby, just look how lucky we got

Saturday morning and we got no other place to be
Baby, when you're lying in my arms we seem to fit so perfectly
Oh honey, honey, please just stay right next to me
Maybe we could do this other day of the week

It's a little, it's a little luck, it's a little so oh, oh, oh, what

'Cause I'm not awake but walk in a state
Of ghostly charm, a deadly calm
And my filthy palms reach for the harms

Today's tonight, tonight's today, today's tonight
Today's tonight, tonight's today, today's tonight
Tonight's today, today's tonight, tonight's today
Everyday, everyday, everyday

Tonight just became this morning
The sun waves at the moon
The thought has just started dawning
As I still so much more that I can do

I shuffle into the sunlight
A zombie roaming on the day
She look's at me and says what a sight
A passing woman says

Today's tonight, tonight's today, today's tonight
Today's tonight, tonight's today, today's tonight
Tonight's today, today's tonight, tonight's today
Every night's the same

I'm ringing church bells, church bells

I'll leave you now
In safe hands
Cool your soul
It's love still stands

But failing that
Just cool down
Wouldn't you love to make it
Is this real or am I just imagining

With wings take flight
The rose of why
And with that rose
The case is closed

But I need you now
To help me somehow
Well I’m scared to face it
This final kiss
But I know I’ll remember it

You gave your best to me
Allow yourself to be
Free

It raids your memory
Still I’m sorry for failing
A time for change
Well I need you now
To help me out
Well I’m scared to face this
A final kiss
But I know you'll remember it

TITLE: Pare Ko Lyrics
LYRICS:
[Verse 1:]
Pare ko meron akong problema
Wag mong sabihing na naman
In-lab ako sa isang kolehiyala
Hindi ko maintindihan

[Bridge 1:]
Wag na nating idaan
Sa maboteng usapan
Lalo lang madaragdagan
Ang sakit ng ulo at bilbil sa tiyan

[Verse 2:]
Anong sarap
Kami'y naging magkaibigan
Napuno ako ng pag-asa
Yun pala haggang dun lang ang kaya
Akala ko ay pwede pa

[Bridge 2:]
Masakit mang isipin
Kailangang tanggapin
Kung kelan ka naging seryoso
Saka ka niya gagaguhin

[Chorus:]
O, Diyos ko, ano ba naman ito
'Di ba, tang ina, nagmukha akong tanga
Pinaasa niya lang ako, lecheng pag-ibig to
Diyos ko, ano ba naman ito

Sabi niya ayaw niya munang magkasyota
Dehins ako naniwala
Di nagtagal, naging ganun na rin ang tema
Kulang na lang ay sagot niya

[Bridge 3:]
Ba't ba ang labo niya
Di ko maipinta
Hanggang kelan maghihintay
Ako ay nabuburat na

CODA:
Pero minamahal ko siya
Di biro, T.L. ako sa kanya
Alam kong nababaduyan ka na sa mga sinasabi ko
Pero sana naman ay maintindihan mo

[Verse 4:]
O pare ko {o pare ko}, meron ka bang maipapayo
Kung wala ay okey lang {kung wala ay okey lang}
Kailangan lang {kailangan lang} ay ang iyong pakikiramay
Andito ka ay ayos na {andito ka ay ayos na}

[Repeat 2nd Bridge]

I wandered so aimless, life filled with sin
I wouldn't let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in the night
Praise the lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light
No more darkness, no more night
Now I'm so happy, no sorrow in sight
Praise the lord, I saw the light

Just like a blind man, I wandered alone
Worries and fears I claimed for my own
Then like the blind man that God gave back his sight
Praise the lord, I saw the light

I was a fool to wander and stray
For straight is the gate and narrow the way
Now I have traded the wrong for the right
Praise the lord, I saw the light

I saw the light, I saw the light

TITLE: You're All I Wanted Lyrics
LYRICS:
We only talk 
Every once in a while 
But when we do 
I'm reminded you 
Are the only one i crave 
To return the love i gave 
It's problematic
'Cause you're with her 
And i'm sure she's lovely too 
But does it occur 
To her that you'll more than do 
'Cause if i had the chance 
There'd be no second glance 
It's problematic
You've got your traits 
And god do i miss them 
If my memory fades 
I'll need you more then 
I'm not sure if i can 
Be your biggest fan 
It's problematic
You're all i wanted 
And yeah it's simple but so is it truthful
If you hear this 
You'll know it's about you 
Like every song i write 
And none of them do 
So i write and write again 
To release more of this pain 
It's problematic
You may roll your eyes 
Over before it starts 
You cut all you ties 
But they're tied around my heart 
And i'll never let go 
Till i'm satisfied you know 
It's problematic
You're all i wanted 
And yeah it's simple but so is it truthful
I've heard you've changed 
But how am i to know? 
I don't see your face 
It's not something you show 
A blessing in disguise? 
Or a sight for sore eyes? 
It's problematic
You're all i wanted 
And yeah it's simple but god is it truthful

I am lost in a rainbow
No a rainbow is gone
Overcast by your shadow
As our worlds move on

In this shirt I can be you
To be near you for a while
In this shirt I can be you
To be near you for a while

There's a crane knocking down
All these things that we were
I awake in the night to
Hear the engines pout

There's a pain it does ripple
Through my frame makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shape it's the prize

Of you and me ever changing
Moving on now moving fast
And this touch must be wanting
Must become free to act

But I mean jape to tell you
That I love you and never rash
And I bled everyday now
For a year for a year

I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names there together
Must've fallen like the sea

To depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind I can hear you
Call my name held the sound

I am lost
I am lost in a rainbow
No a rainbow is gone
I am lost in a rainbow
No a rainbow is gone

I am lost, I am lost
I am lost, I am lost
I am lost

Then I don't think I would know where to begin
If I couldn't do all those bad things I loved to do

Pick you up and put you in a shirt and a collar

That I'm just wild and free
When all I hope to do is find someone
Whose heart will beat in time with mine
But I don't have a treasure map
And love like that can be so hard to find

I'll send a signal out to every burning heart
We'll wander through the night and light up like stars
I'll find my way to you so go ahead and shine
We'll be together when all the stars align

All the lonesome valentine's and poetry
That never rhymes with me
All the broken romances and second chances
That I'll never see
When all I hope to do is find someone
Whose heart will beat in time with mine
But I don't have a treasure map
And love like that can be so hard to find

I'll send a signal out to every burning heart
We'll wander through the night and light up like stars
I'll find my way to you so go ahead and shine
