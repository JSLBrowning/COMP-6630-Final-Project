[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 2: Logic]
I been at it with my homies
It don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bustin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
Cause I'm a sucker for pain

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Outro: Sam Harris]
More pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
For more pain
Got me begging....

[Verse 1]
Can't keep my hands to myself
Think I'll dust 'em off, put 'em back up on the shelf
In case my little baby girl is in need
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 1]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 2]
Got another mouth to feed
Leave her with a baby sitter, mama, call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Am I coming out of left field?

[Chorus 2]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I been feeling it since 1966, now
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Verse 3]
We could fight a war for peace
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies
We could wave until the walls come down
(Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now)
It's time to give a little tip
Kids in the middle, move over 'til it falls
Don't bother me

[Bridge]
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming?
Is it coming back?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

[Chorus 3]
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
I've been feeling it since 1966, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, now
Let me kick it like it's 1986, now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Might've had your fill, but you feel it still

LYRICS:
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
Got no way to prove it so maybe I'm blind

But I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me

Take a look in the mirror and what do you see
Do you see it clearer or are you deceived in what you believe

Cos I'm only human after all, you're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry, making you cry

Cos I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me, don't put the blame on me

Some people got the real problems
Some people out of luck
Some people think I can solve them
Lord heavens above
I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me
I'm only human I make mistakes
I'm only human that's all it takes to put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

I'm no prophet or messiah
Should go looking somewhere higher

I'm only human after all, I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me, don't put the blame on me
I'm only human I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

LYRICS:
First things first
I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my soul into the masses
Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heart ache from the pain
Take up my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My luck, my love, my God, they came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My luck, my love, my God, they came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained down
It rained down, like...

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, you built me up, believer, believer
Pain!
I let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My luck, my love, my God, they came from...
Pain!

LYRICS:
Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

Into the wild, canyons of youth
Oh there's a world to fall into
Wages will dance, like kids on the moon
Oh I will give myself to you
As soon as you start to let go

Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

Wave after wave, as he goes too deep
Oh I will build my mystery
As soon as you start to let go

Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

Mist on the mountain rising from the ground
Thereâ€™s no denying beauty makes a sound
Feet canâ€™t escape it thereâ€™s no way to doubt
Mist on the mountain rising all around

Give me your heart, Give me your song
Sing it with all your might
Come to the fountain and you can be satisfied
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify
There is a peace, there is a love
You can get lost inside
Come to the fountain and let me hear you testify

(feat. Kiiara)


I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah I drive myself crazy
Cause I can't escape the gravity

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy

You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy

I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy

[Verse 1]
Look at you kids with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

[Pre-Chorus]
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy

[Chorus]
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter cause it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

[Verse 2]
Look at you kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues
But that don't mean that you should abuse it

[Pre-Chorus]
Though It's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love (ah, ah)
To be young and in love (ah, ah)

[Bridge]
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm (ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (ah, ah)

And It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

[Chorus]
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love (ah, ah)
I'm young and in love (ah, ah)

Hmm (ah, ah)

feat. Pusha T & Mavis Staples


[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Mama Mavis, oh
Mama, they tried my patience
Obama is gone, who is left to save us?
So together we mourn, I'm praying for my neighbors
They say the devil's at work and Trump is calling favors
You say I'm dangerous, I speak for the nameless
I fly with the vultures, I be with them bangers
If change don't come, then the change won't come
If the bands make 'em dance, then the rain gon' come
(Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?) Look into your eyes
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark, let me out)
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change come to pass
Change come to pass
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in time
But I won't get tired at all

[Refrain: 2-D]
Let me out, let me out
Let me out, let me out

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Look into my eyes, mama, tell me what you see
Tell me there's a chance for me to make it off the streets
Tell me that I won't die at the hands of the police
Promise me I won't outlive my nephew and my niece
Promise me my pastor isn't lyin' as he preach
Tell me that they'll listen if it's lessons that I teach
Tell me there's a heaven in the sky where there is peace
But until then, I keep my piece in arm's reach
(Yeah!)

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change coming
You'd best be ready for it

[Chorus: 2-D]
Something I've begun to fear is about to change its form
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a shift in times
But I won't get tired at all

[Pre-Chorus: Mavis Staples]
Am I passin' into the light?
(Am I looking into mercy's eyes?)
All the world is out of your hands
(Then ascending into the dark) Another night
You got to die a little if you wanna live
Change is coming
You'd best be ready

[Verse 1]
And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
Cause I'm a red blooded man
But I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

[Verse 2]
Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

[Bridge]
Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

[Chorus 2]
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

My life is real great
feel Iâ€™m well on my way to my dreams coming true and Iâ€™m getting to do it with you.
and it feels so nice when the people sing along
singing along with the banjo

Iâ€™d take it all back, take it all back, take it all back.
Iâ€™d take it all back just to have you.
Iâ€™d take it all back, take it all back, take it all back.
Iâ€™d take it all back just to have you.

One day we might have a big house with nice cars and fancy clothes
with a wife in a big ole diamond ring
cause the people are dancing along dancing along to the mando and some sort of hip-hop beat.

Iâ€™d take it all back, take it all back, take it all back.
Iâ€™d take it all back just to have you.
Iâ€™d take it all back, take it all back, take it all back.
Iâ€™d take it all back just to have you.

When the pulsing looks to die for
Take it in your heart now, lover
When the case is out
And tired and sodden
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart

[Bridge: D.R.A.M.]
Back to when it was cool
'Cause there's no substitute
Who even knows the truth?
The truth, the truth

[Chorus: 2-D & D.R.A.M.]
Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Where it all goes down

[Verse 2: 2-D]
Outside, cold and ghosting out with jet lag
I took it to the right man
Took it all back
When the courts were closing
It was Bobby gracing
I know that
A bullet to the right man
He pulled it back

[Verse 3: D.R.A.M.]
Caught in your eyes
Stacks of lights
Come streaming back
Make it for the best times
Growing pains, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times
Good times, good times

Take it in your heart now, lover
Take it in your heart, heart, heart, heart
Take it in your heart
Take it in your heart
Where it all goes down

What did I do?

LYRICS:
Thereâ€™s an infestation in my mindâ€™s imagination
I hope they choke on smoke cause Iâ€™m smoking them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop
Just another attempt to make the voices stop
Rapping to prove nothing, just writing to say something
Cause I wasnâ€™t the only one who wasnâ€™t rushing to say nothing
This doesnâ€™t mean I lost my dream
Itâ€™s just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean

Gangsters donâ€™t cry
Therefore, therefore Iâ€™m
Mr. Misty-eye, therefore Iâ€™m

Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

No I didnâ€™t understand the thing you said
If I didnâ€™t know better, I guess youâ€™re all already dead
Mindless zombies walking around with a limp and a hunch
Saying stuff like, "you only live once"
You got one time to figure it out
One time to twist and one time to shout
One time to think and I say we start now
Sing with me if you know what Iâ€™m talking about

Gangsters donâ€™t cry
Therefore, therefore Iâ€™m
Mr. Misty-eye, therefore Iâ€™m

Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit

Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save
Can you save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
For me, for me, oh
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

Can you save
Can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?
Can you save
Can you save my, save my
Can you save my heavy dirty soul?

Immigrant Song
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
>From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying:
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore.
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
>From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow.
How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war.
We are your overlords.
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore.
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing.
