LYRICS:
Wegue
Wegue wegue wegue
Wegue
Wegue wegue wegue

Quando eu entro o palco se move,
Talento aqui chove,
Claro que o povo me ouve
Sou Pongolove
Estou com a Buraka
Abro a fronteira
Não digo lixo
Nem digo asneira
No microfone sou a primeira
Vou levantar a minha bandeira

Angola o mundo cobiça
Mas é o povo que te enfeitiça
A Pong no beat capricha
Porque sou rara tipo welwitchia
Sou mesmo eu a dama ngaxi muito agressiva
Me derrubar nem com macumba
Sou criativa

A Buraka é que está a cuiar
Sai fora
Pongolove é que esta a bater
Vão se embora

Wegue
Wegue wegue wegue
São piadas
Wegue
Wegue wegue wegue
Novo esquema

Rima pesada
Tipo embondeiro
Eu faço o que eu quero
Canto para Angola
E para o mundo inteiro
No kuduro impero

Sou palanca negra gigante
Sigo a passada de Njinga Mbandi
Sigo a corrente do Dande

Logro o feitiço de Tomé Grande

Por no mapa Oxaena
Terra de grandes nomes do semba
Arraso tipo kalemba
Sou de Angola como a mulemba

Mano jukula
(Kimbundu)
Mambo exclusivo
Toque de Angola

BÃ©same, bÃ©same mucho
Como si fuera esta noche la Ãºltima vez
BÃ©same, bÃ©same mucho

Quiero tenerte muy cerca
Mirarme en tus ojos, verte junto a mi
Pienso que tal vez maÃ±ana
Yo estarÃ© muy lejos
Muy lejos de tÃ­

LYRICS:
When I look at all the choices I made in my life
It’s like some natural law
When they bring me trouble and strife
I find my way to your door
Like a wheel , turning round  and round
I always find you
And lay my head down
We’re like some warriors from some forgotten war
Recalling songs from a long forgotten shore

CHORUS

YITHI UMANQOBA ( we are the victorious
SESANQOBA IZIZWE( we conquered the world
UMA UFUNA THINA  WOZA!( if you want to take us on , come!

Broken silence is what I dream
Who has the words to close the distance
Between you and me

Encore plus loin, encore plus fort 
PrÃªte Ã  payer le prix de lâ€™effort 
Jour aprÃ¨s jour, mon corps se durcit 
Chacun de mes gestes est plus prÃ©cis 
Je sens mes muscles se tendre 
Câ€™est le moment oÃ¹ je vais me battre 
Et je rendrai coup pour coup 
Je ne me laisserai pas abattre 
Je montrerai ma force et ma puissance 
Je nâ€™aurai plus de limites 
Toujours plus vite 
Je connaÃ®trai la douceur de la victoire 
Et jâ€™oublierai la douleur aprÃ¨s la gloire 

Je deviendrai dure comme lâ€™acier 
Une liane souple faite pour rÃ©sister 
Bien respirer, tout expirer 
Face au danger lâ€™esprit aiguisÃ© 
Je sens sur moi la pression 
Je ne me ferai pas dÃ©passer 
Câ€™est dans le coeur de lâ€™action 
Que je pourrai enfin tout donner 
Je montrai ma force et ma puissance 
Je nâ€™aurai plus de limites 
Toujours plus vite

Eu vim lá do Brasil
P?ra fazer o tour na Europa.
Morta de saudade
Na cabeça só piroca.
Com medo de errar o linguajado português
Eu tinha-me esquecido eu só não sei falar inglês.

Queria só saber qual é o gesto que se usa
Pois é muito engraçado
A camisola ser uma blusa.
Mas Deus sabe o que faz
Fez você falar o inglês.
Se tu me molestar
Te mando gesto português.

Aqui p?ra vocês (4x)

London Town
London Town
Walking down the sidewalk on a purple afternoon
I was accosted by a barker playing a simple tune
Upon his flute  - toot toot toot toot

Silver rain was falling down
Upon the dirty ground of London Town

People pass me by on my imaginary street
Ordinary people it's impossible to meet
Holding conversations that are always incomplete
Well, I don't know
Oh where are there places to go
Someone somewhere has to know
I don't know

Out of work again the actor entertains his wife
With the same old stories of his ordinary life
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife
Well, I don't know
Oh, where are there places to go
Someone somewhere has to know

Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon
I was arrested by a rozzer wearing a pink balloon
About his foot - toot toot toot toot

Silver rain was falling down
Upon the dirty ground of London Town

Someone somewhere has to know
Silver rain was falling down
Upon the dirty ground of London Town

I can almost remember their funny faces
That time you told 'em that you were going to be marrying soon
And Jet,
I thought the only lonely place was on the moon
Jet! Oo Jet! Oo

Jet! Was your father as bold as a sergeant major?
Well how come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet?
And Jet,
I thought the major was a lady suffragette
Jet! Oo Jet! Oo

Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me?
Ah, mater, want Jet to always love me?
Ah, mater, much later

Jet! With the wind in your hair of a thousand laces
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky
And Jet,

LYRICS:
Far between sundown's finish and midnight's broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts, struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing

Flashing for the warriors, whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far off corner flashed
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting

Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail
For the lonesome hearted lovers, with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
'Cause we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended

Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

LYRICS:
Do you hear me Father Bamba?
Did they hear you Father Bamba?
Do you hear me Father Bamba?
Did they hear you Father Bamba?

We didn't know who you'd become
Until the word was spread
But now the story of your people
Can be shouted out loud

Your faith, your sorrow in your journey
A tale between God and the man
Your prayers, our prayers
Oh no, they will not be ignored

Do you hear me Father Bamba?
Did they hear you Father Bamba?
Do you hear me Father Bamba?
Did they hear you Father Bamba?

The man in me changes
Every time I read your khassayids
My strong faith in you
Makes me survive in this crazy world

Now I can go anywhere
Because I know you'll be there
We know your pain will always
Make us stronger Mame Bamba

Every day, every night, every moment
They are singing and they are crying
You may be gone but your spirit will remain
And it will stay until the end of time

Your faith and your sorrow in your journey
A tale between God and the man
Your prayers, our prayers
Oh no, they will not be ignored

Every day, every night, every moment
They are singing and they are crying
Every day, every night, every moment
They are singing and they are crying
Every day, every night, every moment
They are singing and they are crying

Your faith, your sorrow in your journey
A tale between God and the man
Your prayers, our prayers
Oh no, oh no, they will not be ignored

LYRICS:
Boul ma sene, boul ma guiss madi re nga fokni mane
Khamouma li neka thi sama souf ak thi guinaw
Beugouma kouma khol oaldine yaw li neka si yaw
Mo ne si man, li ne si mane moye dilene diapale

Roughneck and rudeness
We should be using
On the ones who practice wicked charms

For the sword and the stone
Bad to the bone
Battle is not over
Even when it's won

And when a child is born
Into this world
It has no concept
Of the tone the skin is livin' in

It's not a second
7 seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting

It's not a second
7 seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting

J'assume les raisons qui nous poussent de changer tout
J'aimerais qu'on oublie leur couleur pour qu'ils esperent
Beaucoup de sentiments de races qui font qu'ils desesperent
Je veux les portes grandements ouvertes
Des amis pour parler de leur peine, de leur joie
Pour qu'ils leur filent des infos qui ne divisent pas
Changer

7 seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting

It's not a second
7 seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting

And when a child is born
Into this world
It has no concept
Of the tone the skin is livin' in

And there's a million voices
And there's a million voices
To tell you what she should be thinkin'
So you better sober up for just a second

7 seconds away
But just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting

It's not a second
7 seconds away
Just as long as I stay
I'll be waiting

Heat Dust Dreams
The Crossing (Osiyeza)
(for Dudu)

Through all the days that eat away
at every breath that I take
through all the nights I've lain alone
in someone else's dream, awake
all the words in truth we have spoken
that the wind has blown away
it's only you that remains with me
clear as the light of day

Chorus: O Siyeza, o siyeza , sizofika webaba noma
(we are coming, we are coming, we will arrive soon)
O siyeza, o siyeza, siyagudle lomhlaba
(we are coming, we are coming, we are moving across this earth)
Siyawela lapheshaya lulezontaba ezimnyama
(we are crossing over those dark mountains)
Lapha sobheka phansi konke ukhulupheka
(where we will lay down our troubles)

A punch drunk man in a downtown bar 
takes a beating without making a sound
through swollen eyes he sways and smiles
'cause noone can put him down
inside of him a boy looks up to his father
for a sign or an approving eye
oh, it's funny how those once so close and now gone
can still so affect our lives

Chorus

Take me now, hold me close
don't let go, I'm coming home

Chorus
