TITLE: The Rose Lyrics
LYRICS:
Some say love, it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger an endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower and you, it's only seed

It's the heart, afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
It's the dream, afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
And the soul, afraid of dying that never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter far beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the rose

TITLE: Wind Beneath My Wings Lyrics
LYRICS:
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It must have been cold there in my shadow
To never have sunlight on your face
You were content to let me shine, that's your way
You always walked a step behind

So I was the one with all the glory
While you were the one with all the strength
A beautiful face without a name for so long
A beautiful smile to hide the pain

Did you ever know that you're my hero
And everything I would like to be?
I can fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

It might have appeared to go unnoticed
But I've got it all here in my heart
I want you to know, I know the truth, of course I know it
I would be nothing without you

Did you ever know that you're my hero?
You're everything I wish I could be
I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings

Did I ever tell you you're my hero?
You're everything, everything I wish I could be
Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle
For you are the wind beneath my wings
'Cause you are the wind beneath my wings

Oh, the wind beneath my wings
You, you, you, you are the wind beneath my wings
Fly, fly, fly away, you let me fly so high
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings
Oh, you, you, you, the wind beneath my wings

Fly, fly, so high against the sky
So high I almost touch the sky
Thank you, thank you
Thank God for you, the wind beneath my wings

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say
On a bright Hawaiian Christmas Day
That's the island greeting that we send to you
From the land where palm trees sway

And that's the island greeting that we sing to you
From the land where palm trees sway

And all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way

And all the stars at night
Mele Kalikimaka is Hawaii's way
To say Merry Christmas to you

Mele Kalikimaka is the thing to say

To say Merry Christmas
A very Merry Christmas
A very, very, Merry, Merry Christmas

TITLE: If I Didn't Care
LYRICS:
If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my ev'ry prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

If I didn't care honey child, mo' than words can say. If I didn't
Care baby, would I feel this way? Darlin' if this isn't love, then why do I thrill so
Much? What is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round while my heart just stands
Still so much?

If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would my ev'ry prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

Lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli, lollipop, lollipop

Call my baby lollipop, tell you why
His kiss is sweeter than an apple pie
And when he does his shaky rockin' dance
Man, I haven't got a chance

I call him lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli, lollipop lollipop

Sweeter than candy on a stick
Huckleberry, chimry or lime
If you had a choice he'd be your pick
But lollipop is mine

Lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli
Lollipop, lollipop

Crazy way he thrills me, tell you why
Just like a lightning from the sky
He loves to kiss me till I can't see straight
Gee, my lollipop is great

I call him lollipop, lollipop
Oh lolli, lolli, lolli, lollipop, lollipop

Y arriba Jerez, Zacatecas Senores!!!
Yeste es la numero uno BANDA JEREZ OIGA con los Tucanes sis senor
Abranse que llevo lumbre,
o se quitan o los quito,
ya saben que yo no juego,
tengo fama de maldito,
por si no saben yo soy,
el papa de los pollitos,
la plaza me pertenece,
mientras viva,
yo decido,
y el que se meta se muere,
si no se arregla conmigo,
yo no respeto a niveles,
menos mi cuerno de chivo,
ya saben que soy el jefe,
y que conmigo no pueden,
mas vale que me respetenporque son bravos mis plebes
con una clave se activan
y eso si pecan de crueles,
sigo recrutando gente,
mi negocio,
lo a merita el estado
sinaloense es el que mas participa,
jalisco y tierra caliente,
y merito Jerez Zacatecas!!!,
tengo los nervios de acero
es herencia de familia,
a nada le tengo miedo
me crie al estilo Luis
por eso en que cualquier terreno
mi cartel puro pa riba
ya saben que soy el buey
y que no soy tan Jotito
mas vale que me respeten
por que los traigo cortitos
y les recuerdo que soy el papa de los pollitos.

LYRICS:
Infant holy, infant lowly
For His bed a cattle stall
Oxen lowing, little knowing
Christ, the babe is Lord of all

Swift are winging, angels singing
Noels ringing, tidings bringing
Christ, the babe is Lord of all

Flocks were sleeping, shepherds keeping
Vigil till the morning new
Saw the glory, heard the story
Tidings of a gospel true

Thus rejoicing, free from sorrow
Praises voicing greet the morrow
Christ, the babe was born for you
Christ, the babe was born for you

Stars were gleaming, shepherds dreaming
Oh, the night was dark and chill
Angels' story, manger glory
Shepherds heard it on the hill

Ah, that singing, hear it ringing
Earthward winging, praises bringing
Christ, the babe was born for you
Christ, the babe was born for you
Christ, the babe was born for you

LYRICS:
Me dejaste abrazado de un poste
Esperandote y nunca llegaste
Me dijiste que ahi te esperara
Bien recuerdo que me lo juraste
Ya muy noche me fui de la esquina
Y a tomar me meti a una cantina

Me sente y le pedi al cantinero
Una copa y después la botella
Junto a mi se arrimo un compañero
Que muy triste me dijo su pena
El tambien se quedo en una esquina
Y a la cita tampoco fue ella

Conversamos, le dije tu nombre
Dirección y la casa en que vives
Un cigarro me pidio aquel hombre
Cantinero... otra copa nos sirve
Ya no sigas me dijo llorando
Es la misma que estuve esperando

Conversamos, le dije tu nombre
Dirección y la casa en que vives
Un cigarro me pidio aquel hombre
Cantinero... otra copa nos sirve
Ya no sigas me dijo llorando
Es la misma que estuve esperando

TITLE: From A Distance Lyrics
LYRICS:
From a distance the world looks blue and green
And the snow capped mountains white
From a distance the ocean meets the stream
And the eagle takes to flight

From a distance, there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
It's the voice of hope, it's the voice of peace
It's the voice of every man

From a distance we all have enough
And no one is in need
And there are no guns, no bombs, and no disease
No hungry mouths to feed

From a distance we are instruments
Marching in a common band
Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace
They're the songs of every man

God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance

From a distance you look like my friend
Even though we are at war
From a distance I just cannot comprehend
What all this fighting is for

From a distance there is harmony
And it echoes through the land
And it's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
It's the heart of every man
(Every man)

It's the hope of hopes, it's the love of loves
This is the song of every man

And God is watching us, God is watching us
God is watching us from a distance
Oh, God is watching us, God is watching
God is watching us from a distance

Rockapella Two From Ny
Zombie Jamboree
(Conrad Mauge Jr., 3rd verse lyric by Sean Altman)
Vocal arrangement: Sean Altman, David Yazbek & Bill Stral

 *   Back to back!  Belly to belly!  Yes, my friends,
     Back to back! Ha ha ha ha! Belly to belly.

 *   Repeat

It was a Zombie Jamboree,
Took place in the New York Cemetery.
It was a Zombie Jamboree,
Took place in the New York Cemetery.

Zombies from all parts of the island
Some of them were great calypsonians.
Since the season was carnival,
They got together in bacchanal
HUH! And they were singing:

**   Back to back, belly to belly
     Well I don't give a damn
     'Cause I'm stoned dead already!
     Back to back, belly to belly
     It's a Zombie Jamboree

One female zombie, she wouldn't behave,
She how she's dancing out of the grave.
In one hand she's holding a quart of rum;
The other hand is knocking a conga drum.

You know the lead singer starts
To make his rhyme,
While the other zombies rockin' in time.
One bystander, he had this to say,
"It was a trip to see the zombies break away"
SHAH!  And they were singing:

**   Repeat twice

Back to back!  Everyone we sing
"Back to Back!"  And Belly to belly;
Then Back to back! One two three four....

Yeah, what a Zombie Jamboree;
>From Times Square to the Statue of Liberty.
Uptown, Downtown, Zombie Jamboree!
Wow!  Yeah!  There's a high-wire zombie
'Tween the World Trades,
A King Kong zombie on the Empire State,
But the biggest zombies, Tokyo to Rome,
The zombies who call this city "home."

Hah!  What they do!  Huh!

**   Repeat and fade

The Rose
The Rose
Some say love, it is a river
that drowns the tender reed.
Some say love, it is a razor
that leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger,
an endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower,
and you its only seed.

It's the heart afraid of breaking
that never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking
that never takes the chance.
It's the one who won't be taken,
who cannot seem to give,
and the soul afraid of dyin'
that never learns to live.

When the night has been too lonely
and the road has been too long,
and you think that love is only
for the lucky and the strong,
just remember in the winter
far beneath the bitter snows
lies the seed that with the sun's love
in the spring becomes the rose.

Baby mine, don't you cry
Baby mine, dry your eyes
Rest your head close to my heart
Never to part, baby of mine

Little one, when you play
Pay no heed what they say
Let your eyes sparkle and shine
Never a tear, baby of mine

If they knew all about you
They'd end up loving you, too
All those same people who scold you
What they'd give just for the right to hold you

From your hair down to your toes
You're not much, goodness knows
But, you're so precious to me
Sweet as can be, baby of mine

I am a million pieces of the sky*
I found a way to be alone
I'm gonna wait until you want me
Until you finally decide to go home

Diamond, diamond are you all in the sky?
I can't believe all of these beautiful lies
As they surround me I will take a photograph of the sky
Bury me, bury me
Come on, bury me alone in the light

I am, I'm gonna run this like a lion
Another way to be alone
And I will wait until you find me
Until you finally decide to go home

(Don't go home! Don't go home!)

Diamond, diamond are you all in the sky?
I can't believe all of these beautiful lies
As they surround me I will take a photograph of the sky
Bury me, bury me
Come on, bury me alone in the light

I've never had a reason to take me away, yeah
I want it to be over
But I sit here and wait [x2]

I saw her smiling from the top of the world
I saw her sleeping on, amazing I know
If you lower, lower, lower me down
You lower me clearly, so come and lower me

Diamonds, diamonds are you all in the sky?
I can't believe all of these beautiful lies
As they surround me I will take a photograph of the sky
Bury me, bury me

Diamond, diamond are you all in the sky?
I can't believe all of these beautiful lies
As they surround me I will take a photograph of the sky
Bury me, bury me

LYRICS:
I never knew what I would do*
If anybody tried to take you away
And your beautiful boy won't wait for you
Because he's busy with the stars and the fame

And I don't know why I breathe
It's taking too long for me
Can we speed up the process, please?
Or show me the one I need

I need somebody (somebody)
Somebody crazy enough to tell me
I will love you till we (I will love you till we)
Till we are buried
Our bodies (our bodies)
Our bodies buried close together
Cemetery weather
In the cemetery weather

I never knew what I would do
If anybody tried to speak your name
I would tear down their house and
I'd burn my way around the brightest memory of your face

Cause I would do anything (anything, anything)
Cause love is a selfish thing (Don't care what you think)
And I'll feed off the wounds that bleed
And tear you away from me

I need somebody (somebody)
Somebody crazy enough to tell me
I will love you till we (I will love you till we)
Till we are buried
Our bodies (our bodies)
Our bodies buried close together
Cemetery weather
In the cemetery weather

Violence delight
We'll live as if we died
Violence delight
Live as if we died
My violence delight
Live as if we died
My violence delight
Live as if we died
My violence delight, violence delight

So come on, come on
I won't leave without you

If we die then we die
And I'll sing this buried with you

Violence delight
Live as if we die
My violence delight, violence delight

I need somebody (somebody)
Somebody crazy enough to tell me
I will love you till we (I will love you till we)
Till we are buried
Our bodies (our bodies)
Our bodies buried close together

In the cemetery weather

I never knew what I would do

TITLE: El Diablo Lyrics
LYRICS:
Era un hombre deveras valiente
se burlaba de la policia
a su mando traia mucha gente
su negocio se lo requeria
poderozo y tambien muy alegre
como el diablo se le conocia

Donde quiera sonaba su nombre
y tronaba su cuerno de chivo
cada rafaga llevaba un nombre
no fallaba era muy efectivo
lo apreciaban mucho sus patrones
ni se diga su gente y amigos.

El dinero El Poder y La Fama
son tres cosas muy afrodiciacas
sin buscar las mujeres te sobran
solteritas viudas o casadas
a gozar de la vida que es corta
decia El Diablo rodeado de damas
para mi la pobreza es historia
la hize añicos a punta de balas..!!

Somos Gente de El Cartel De El Diablo
les decian a los Federales
de inmediato les abrian el paso
era mas que se activa la clave
saben bien que si no hacian caso
sus cabezas volarian al aire..

En la mafia tambien hay escuela
fue maestro y  ejemplo de varios
le atoraba de frente a cualquiera
fueran leyes o fueran contrarios
los dejaba como coladeras
enojado era el mismito Diablo...

Lo valiente se hereda no hay duda
lo que somos lo aprenden los hijos
las ofensas mas grandes perduran
no se olvidan ni por un ratito
la venganza fue de gran altura
mis respetos para el muchachito
con un cuerno dejo a su familia
no dejo a nadie vivo El Diablito!
