(Christmas)
 The snow's coming down
 (Christmas)
 I'm watching it fall
 (Christmas)
 Lots of people around
 (Christmas)
 Baby please come home

 (Christmas)
 The church bells in town
 (Christmas)
 All ringing in song
 (Christmas)
 Full of happy sounds
 (Christmas)
 Baby please come home

 They're singing "Deck The Halls"
 But it's not like Christmas at all
 I remember when you were here
 And all the fun we had last year

 (Christmas)
 Pretty lights on the tree
 (Christmas)
 I'm watching them shine
 (Christmas)
 You should be here with me
 (Christmas)
 Baby please come home

 They're singing "Deck The Halls"
 But it's not like Christmas at all
 I remember when you were here
 And all the fun we had last year

 (Christmas)
 If there was a way
 (Christmas)
 I'd hold back this tears

 But it's Christmas day

LYRICS:
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is the Bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song while we stroll along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire to face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?" We'll say, "No man"
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire to face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

LYRICS:
My love has no beginning, my love has no end
No front or back and my love won't bend
I'm in the middle, lost in a spin loving you
And you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am

My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, and my love won't drop
I'm in the middle, and I can't stop loving you
And you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am

I wish I were a poet, so I could express
What I'd, what I'd like to say, yeah
I wish I were an artist so I could paint a picture
Of how I feel, of how I feel today

My love has no walls on either side
That makes my love wider than wide
I'm in the middle, and I can't hide loving you
And you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am

And you don't know, you don't know
You don't know, you don't know how glad I am
How glad I am, how glad I am
How glad I am, how glad I am

LYRICS:
I can hear her heartbeat for a thousand miles 
And the heavens open up every time she smiles 
And when I come to her that is where I belong 
Yep I'm running through, like a rivers song 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 

She's got a fine sense of humor when I'm feeling low down 
And when I come to her when the sun goes down 
Takes away my trouble, takes away my grief 
Mmm, takes away all of my heartache in the night like a thief 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Mmm, crazy love
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love (interlude)
Mmmmmmm

Yes I need her in the daytime
Oh, but I need her in the night 
Yes I want to throw my arms around her 
Kiss and hug, kiss and hug her tight 

And when I'm returning from so far away 
She give me some sweet loving, brighten up my day 
Yes it makes me righteous, it makes me feel whole 
And it makes me mellow down to my soul 

She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love, love, love, love, crazy love 
She gives me love
I need her love, love, love, love, crazy love 
Crazy love, crazy love, crazy love.

LYRICS:
Won't you stop and take
A little time out with me
Just take five
Stop your busy day
And take the time out
To see if I'm alive

Though I'm going out of my way
Just so I can pass by each day
Not a single word do we say
It's a pantomime and not a play

Still, I know our eyes often meet
I feel tingles down to my feet
When you smile, that's much too discreet
Sends me on my way

Wouldn't it be better
Not to be so polite
You could offer a light
Start a little conversation now
It's alright, just take five
Just take five

(Repeat all from 2nd verse on)

You better watch out
 You better not cry
 You better not pout
 I'm telling you why
 Santa Claus is coming to town

 He's making a list
 He's checking it twice;
 He's find out who's naughty and nice
 Santa Claus is coming to town

 He sees you when you're sleeping
 And he knows when you're awake
 He knows if you've been bad or good
 So be good for goodness sake!

 You better watch out
 You better not cry
 You better not pout
 I'm telling you why
 Cause Santa Claus is coming to town

 He sees you when you're sleeping
 And he knows when you're awake
 And he knows if you've been bad or good
 So be good for goodness sake!

 You better watch out
 You better not cry
 You better not pout
 I'm telling you why
 Santa Claus is coming to town

 You better watch out
 You better not cry
 You better not pout

 I'm a big fat man with a long white beard
 He's coming to town

LYRICS:
I don't want a lot for Christmas
 There is just one thing I need
 I don't care about those presents
 Underneath the Christmas tree
 I just want you for my own
 More than you could ever know
 Make my wish come true
 You know that all I want for Christmas
 Is you...

 I won't ask for much this Christmas
 I won't even wish for snow
 No, I'm just gonna keep on waiting
 Underneath the mistletoe
 There's no sense in hanging stockings
 There upon the fireplace
 Cause Santa he won't make me happy
 With a toy on Christmas Day
 I just want you here tonight
 Holding on to me so tight
 Girl, what can I do?
 You know that all I want for Christmas
 Is you...

 And all the lights are shining
 So brightly everywhere
 And the sound of children's
 Laughter fills the air
 And everyone is singing
 I can hear those sleigh bells ringing
 Santa won't you bring me the one I really love
 Won't you please bring my baby to me...

 I don't want a lot for Christmas
 This is all I'm asking for
 No, I just wanna see my baby
 Standing right outside my door
 Oh I just want you for my own
 More that you could ever know
 Make my wish come true
 You know that all I want for Christmas
 Is you...
 Is you...

LYRICS:
[feat. Shania Twain]

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 Just like the ones I used to know
 Where the tree tops glisten
 And children listen
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow

 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 With every Christmas card I write
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white

 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 just like the ones I used to know
 Where the tree tops glisten
 And children listen
 To hear sleigh bells in the snow

 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 With every Christmas card I write
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white

 I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
 With every Christmas card I write
 May your days be merry and bright
 And may all your Christmases be white

LYRICS:
We starve, look at one another, short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Somewhere, inside something there is a rush of
Greatness, who knows what stands in front of
Our lives, I fashion my future on films in space
Silence tells me secretly
Everything
Everything

Manchester, England, England
Manchester, England, England
Across the Atlantic Sea
And I'm a genius, genius
I believe in God
And I believe that God believes in Claude
That's me, that's me, that's me

We starve, look at one another, short of breath
Walking proudly in our winter coats
Wearing smells from laboratories
Facing a dying nation of moving paper fantasy
Listening for the new told lies
With supreme visions of lonely tunes

Singing our space songs on a spider web sitar
Life is around you and in you
Answer for Timothy Leary, dearie

Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in

Let the sunshine, let the sunshine in

Miscellaneous
Halls Of Montezuma
From the Halls of Montezuma 
To the Shores of Tripoli; 
We will fight our country's battles 
In the air, on land and sea; 
First to fight for right and freedom 
And to keep our honor clean; 
We are proud to claim the title 
of United States Marine. 

Our flag's unfurled to every breeze 
From dawn to setting sun; 
We have fought in ev'ry clime and place 
Where we could take a gun; 
In the snow of far-off Northern lands 
And in sunny tropic scenes; 
You will find us always on the job-- 
The United States Marines. 

Here's health to you and to our Corps 
Which we are proud to serve 
In many a strife we've fought for life 
And never lost our nerve; 
If the Army and the Navy 
Ever look on Heaven's scenes; 
They will find the streets are guarded 
By United States Marines.

LYRICS:
When you're alone, silence is all you'll know.
When you're alone, silence is all you'll know.
Let in the noise and let it grow.

When you're alone, silence is all you see.
When you're alone, silence is all you'll be
Give me your hand and come to me.

When you are here, music is all around.
When you are near, music is all around.
Open your eyes, don't make a sound.

Let in the shadow, let in the shadow,
Let in the light of your bright shadow.

Let in the shadow, let in the shadow.
Let in the light of your bright shadow.

Let in the light.
Let in the light.
Let in the light of your sweet shadow.

When you're alone, oh,
Silence is all you know.
Silence is all,
Silence is all around.
Silence is all
Silence is all around

Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
 Let your heart be light
 From now on,
 our troubles will be out of sight

 Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
 Make the Yule-tide gay,
 From now on, 
 our troubles will be miles away.

 Here we are as in olden days,
 Happy golden days of yore.
 Faithful friends who are dear to us
 Gather near to us once more.

 Through the years 
 We all will be together,
 If the Fates allow
 Hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
 And have yourself A merry little Christmas now.

 Faithful friends who are dear to us
 Gather near to us once more.

 Through the years 
 We all will be together,
 If the Fates allow
 So hang a shining star upon the highest bough.
 And have yourself A merry little Christmas now.

Have a holly jolly Christmas
 It's the best time of the year
 Well I don't know if there'll be snow
 But have a cup of cheer

 Have a holly jolly Christmas
 And when you walk down the street
 Say hello to friends you know
 And everyone you meet

 Ho ho the mistletoe
 Is hung where you can see
 Somebody waits for you
 Kiss her once for me

 Have a holly jolly Christmas
 And in case you didn't hear
 Oh bygolly have a holly jolly Christmas

Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

Now you say you're sorry,
For being so untrue

Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river,
I cried a river over you.

You drove me nearly out of my head
While you never shed a tear, babe
Remember, I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me
And now you say you love
Well just to prove that you do
Why don't you cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cause I cried a river over you, over you

You say you love me but you lied

Now, you say you love me
Well just to prove that you
Come on and cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

I cried a river,
Over you

I cried a river
Now you can too
cry me a river
Cry me... a river

I'm not surprised
Not everything lasts
I've broken my heart so many times
I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in
I talk myself out
I get all worked up
Then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I thought of every possibility

And I know someday that it'll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you kid that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait
I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing
And the other half's luck
Wherever you are
Whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere
And into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

And somehow I know that it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And promise you kid I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

They say all's fair in love and war
But I won't need to fight it
We'll get right
And we'll be united

And I know that we can be so amazing
And being in your life is gonna change me
And now I can see every single possibility

And someday I know it'll all turn out
And I'll work to work it out
Promise you kid I'll give more than I get
Than I get

Oh you know it'll all turn out
And you'll make me work so we can work to work it out

It's time to win a chance to butt-bang
Your daughter's tight virgin cherry ass

All I can think about is playin' with myself
It's time to masturbate
Well I've got my â€~Hustler' and I don't need nothin' else

But the girls of porn want more

My hand gets tired and my dick gets sore
But the girls of porn want more

LYRICS:
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
 Ev'rywhere you go; 
 Take a look at the five and ten glistening once again 
 With candy canes and silver lanes aglow. 

 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
 Toys in ev'ry store 
 But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
 On your own front door. 

 A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots 
 Is the wish of Barney and Ben; 
 Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk 
 Is the hope of Janice and Jen; 
 And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again. 

 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
 Ev'rywhere you go; 
 There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well, 
 The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow. 

 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas; 
 Soon the bells will start, 
 And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing 
 Right within your heart

 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas 
 Toys in ev'ry store 
 But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be 
 On your own front door.

 So it's Christmas once more...

Didn't they always say we were the lucky ones?
I guess that we were once
Babe, we were once

But luck will leave you cause
It is a faithless friend
And in the end when life has got you down
You've got someone here that you can wrap your arms around

So hold on to me tight
Hold on to me tonight
We are stronger here together
Than we could ever be alone
So hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go

There's a thousand ways for things to fall apart
But it's no one's fault
No it's not my fault

Maybe all the plans we made would not work out
But I have no doubt even though it's hard to see
I've got faith in us and I believe in you and me

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright
Cause it's you and me together
And baby all we've got is time
So hold on to me, hold on to me tonight

There's so many dreams that we have given up
Take a look at all we've got
And with this kind of love
What we've got here is enough

So hold on to me tight
Hold on, I promise it'll be alright
Cause we are stronger here together
Then we could ever be alone
Just hold on to me
Don't you ever let me go
Hold on to me, it's gonna be alright
