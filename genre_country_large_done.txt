TITLE: Redneck Love Song
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I'm a simple man, ain't no other way to say it
Lay my cards on the table, only way I play it
I got some draw in my yaw, they can't imitate it
Tough and rowdy reckless
Rough around the edges
Ever since you came around I've been
Thinking thoughts that I need to get out so I
I grabbed a pen and a napkin 
And I wrote this down
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you
Yeah, I know it might sound a little elementary
Like a nursery rhyme straight up from the country
It won't pass for Shakespeare, girl I know it
But I'mma pour my heart out like a backboard's poet
My tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
And I love you
Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you, I love you
Yeah, my tractor's green, my pasture's greener
My tea is sweet but honey, you're sweeter
My road is dirt, your heart is gold
I'm a man of few words but baby here it goes
My neck is red, my collar's blue
Yeah, I love your pretty smile
I love your skinny jeans
I love the fact that you fell for a good ol' boy like me
I love your long kiss
And I love your long hair
I wanna shout it out from the town square
That I love you
I love you
I love you
Yes, I do

TITLE: Stand Alone
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I've made my share of empty promises
Not like you care anymore
I wish you did, but I've done all I can do
Baby, I ain't gonna chase you out that door
If you don't know by now that you're the one I love
Clearly we were never meant to be
If you take the words
Out of someone else's mouth before you take mine
Well I got nothing left to say
Oh, I'll stand alone
It won't be the first time or the last time
That I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me
'Cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standing alone
Just the other day driving down the highway
Seen a Chevrolet, reminded me of you
I almost called, but I'm sure glad I didn't
I just shook it off and drank some Mountain Dew
You always said, that it was bad for my health
Well baby, you can go to hell
While I stand alone
It won't be the first time or the last time
That I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me
'Cause I won't pick up the phone
I'm standing alone
The waves will clash and the winds will blow
But I'll be here standing on my tip toes
Oh, I'll stand alone
It won't be the first time or the last time
I'm gonna make it on my own
Oh, I'll stand alone
Don't be sorry, don't call me
'Cause I won't pick up my phone
I'm standing alone
I'm standing alone
I'm standing alone
Standing alone

TITLE: Talkin' Tennessee
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
You say those city boys living in those high rise condos
Only left you feeling low
Those little smoke glass fancy cars sure go fast
But never got you where you wanted to go
All I've ever owned is an old seat '72
Cuddled up, get you falling in love on the bench seat
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl, don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on
Little sweet nothing southernisms, Jack and Seven sipping
Hoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee
You say the street lights only ever let you see the skyline
It's been a long time
Since the Milky Way, Jupiter and Venus took your breath away
Yeah like you're taking mine
What you say we grab some tailgate underneath the stars
Catch a few fireflies in a moonshine jar
Don't mind me, I'm just talking Tennessee
Girl, don't blame me if I slip and call you baby
That's just my way of letting the lady know she's working on me
There I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on
Little sweet nothing southernisms, Jack and Seven sipping
Hoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee
There I go letting my south side show whiskey whispering on
Little sweet nothing southernisms, Jack and Seven sipping
Hoping that you're digging on me talking Tennessee
Talking Tennessee

TITLE: Chain Smokin'
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I think I'm past the point of calling you a... bad habit
Ain't trying to get no sympathy oh... sounds tragic
But it's hard for me to hide your side effects from showing
You strike a match, and I'll burn the lamps, just ambers glowing
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it?
I just keep-
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes like
Binge drinking old fashions cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle droppin in the grooves
I can't stop... Chain chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
I got a couple hit or miss tricks that I use for distraction
But as soon I slow down then I start flashbacking
To the night before when I was
Buzzin' harder than that store front neon
Yeah, if your kiss gets me this high, why wouldn't I just keep on?
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes like
Binge drinking old fashions cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle droppin in the grooves
I can't stop... Chain chain smokin' you
Need a little rush from your touch
Little late night, pick me up
Well, you make me come unwound
Why I can't put you down?
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
I know the first step is just to admit it
But what if I don't want to quit it?
I just keep-
Chain smokin' your love like a pack of Lucky Strikes like
Binge drinking old fashions cherry in the ice
Push a button, watch the needle droppin' in the grooves
I can't stop... Chain chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you
Chain, chain, chain, chain, chain smokin' you (Ohh)
Chain Smokin' you
No, no, no, no

TITLE: Rednecks, Red Letters, Red Dirt
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I need to lean on a truck with five old friends
Tell old lies and then tell 'em again
Ride 33 'til it hits the river
Throw cans in the bed 'til the moon's just a sliver
Wanna see my name on a dive bar wall
Where the ceilings ain't, but the beers are tall
There's something 'bout a city like this
Makes me miss what I grew up with
Red necks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an outback brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away, way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Red necks, red letters, red dirt
I need to hear mama pray 'til the rolls get cold
For them hometown folks that she says I know
My soul's a little dirty 'cause my boots are too clean
It's been too long since I've seen
Red necks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an outback brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away, way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Red necks, red letters, red dirt
Red necks, red letters, red dirt, oh
Yeah, I bet by now they're missin' me
So I ain't stopping 'til I see
Red necks, red letters, red dirt
One light, one bar, one church
Where the Lord gets thanked and the shine gets drank
While an outback brush pile burns
Yeah, I've been away, way too long
But tonight I'm headed back home
'Cause when I need to find me
There's only three things that'll work
Red necks, red letters, red dirt, oh
Red necks, red letters, red dirt
Red necks, red letters, red dirt

TITLE: Beer Don't
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Map dot, southern rock, buckshot, stop sign
Grizz packed, mantle rack, channel cat, trot line
Pipes ain't Bristol, but they pretty loud though
'Round here, the sun goes down slow
But beer don't
Home base, that's the party spot at the Walmart
Second base in the parkin' lot at the ballpark
Sweet cherry pie slice in the boondocks
Skillets and the engines and the women stay hot
But beer don't start nothin' but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip-hop, of course
But it damn sure does with a little nitty-gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how red neck we are
But beer don't
Big boss on your back, 'bout to get a cuss-out
Scopes off, low shot, didn't lay the buck down
Baby says bye and it down right breaks you
Hey, just remember when you think the world hates you
Beer don't start nothin' but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip-hop, of course
But it damn sure does with a little nitty-gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how red neck we are
But beer don't
No, beer don't
One beer, two beer, three beer, four
There's 20 more of 'em behind the fridge door
Five beer, six beer, seven beer, eight
You can keep count, but I'll tell you who ain't
Beer don't start nothin' but the party
Beer don't taste half as good in the city
Beer don't buzz with that hip-hop, of course
But it damn sure does with a little nitty-gritty
Beer don't bust its ass Monday to Friday
Beer don't wanna sit in a glass, so slide it my way
We might drink way too many of 'em at the bar
People got their own opinion about how red neck we are
But beer don't
No, beer don't
Yeah, beer don't

TITLE: Sleep When We're Dead
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
The night is getting late, the crowd's heading home
It's just you and me girl on the late show
I know I just met you but I can't let you go
Forget about your friends, baby, I'll drive you home (Yeah!)
I'll set you on the tailgate, we'll take it nice and slow
I know I'd have to stop, but I won't tell a soul, no
I know you gotta wake up for that nine to five
But what's the point of living, girl
If you don't feel alive?
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, talk that song
'Bout small town lovers, hot summer nights
Midnight dancin' in the headlights
Some day, we might regret leavin' that love out by the lake
If you're gettin' tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed
But we can sleep when we're dead
Put your pretty arms around me, now get in nice and close
Whisper in my ear what you'd like to know
And you can tell me 'bout your family, or tell me 'bout your day
Or our lips can do the talking, let's listen baby, what do you say?
I know it's kinda crazy for a Tuesday night
But sometimes, a good thing don't need time
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Pour another drink, talk that song
'Bout small town lovers, hot summer nights
Midnight dancin' in the headlights
Some day, we might regret leavin' that love out by the lake
If you're gettin' tired honey, we'll put that thought to bed
With a smile she pulled me to water
Them southern girls, man, they just don't get any hotter
I said, "No girl, got on my good jeans"
She looked at me boy like, "What do you mean?"
We can sleep when we're dead, the night is still young
Jump on in, let's have a little fun
Small town lovers, hot summer nights
Out here swimmin' in the moonlight
Some day, we might regret leavin' this love out by the lake
But no matter what you do, don't forget what we said
We can sleep when we're dead
We can sleep when we're dead, aww yeah
We can sleep when we're dead

TITLE: Quittin' Time
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Puttin' in that overtime and comin' up with nothin'
Sure as hell ain't for lack of tryin'
There's no use wastin' time in fightin' for somethin'
When you see that white flag a flyin'
Can you hear that whistle blow?
There's all day thinkin' time an'
All night drinkin' time an'
Time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It's quittin' time
There's somethin' to be said for sayin' what needs sayin'
A suitcase says it all to me
Before the credits roll just know I always loved you
So we wrote that famous final scene
Where you turn and walk out on me
There's all day thinkin' time an'
All night drinkin' time an'
Time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
Give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It's quittin' time
It's quittin' time
Every start has an end
Every first has a last
Every now has a then
Every future has a past
And sometimes you want it back
There's all day thinkin' time an'
All night drinkin' time an'
Time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
Give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It's quittin' time
It's quittin' time

TITLE: Had Me By Halftime
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
You were talkin' trash, we were tossin' bags
When I caught your name at a corn hole game
September Saturday in Rocky Top
On top of G10 parking lot
Said, "Girl, where you sitti'g? I got an extra ticket
It's right on the 50"
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game
Kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
They sent out the pride of the south land band
And all I could think about was holdin' your hand
Was just gonna catch it on a couch TV
And last second scored a couple tickets for free
But baby I'd have paid anything to see
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game
Kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
Now every time the leaves start fallin' down
I get to thinkin' 'bout
You had a 16 home team jersey on
Singin' every word to the fight song
Had your airplane bottles from your purse out
Had a country mile smile every first down
Last thing on my mind was the football
Watchin' you girl like it's gonna be a good fall
You would've thought that post-game
Kiss would've made me wanna make you mine
But you had me by halftime
You had me by halftime
You had me by halftime

ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I've been looking at you from across the room
'Bout time I've got my nerve
Well, you might tell me, "Boy, hell no"
But hell, it can't hurt
'Cause I just wanna spin you around and 'round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
But if you don't do feelings, then baby, if you willing
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sound
Girl, it oughta be a crime
Got a pretty good feeling I'm taking you home
Gonna love you with all I got
But before we slip out into the night
I just want one more shot
To take your hand and
Spin you around and 'round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
But if you don't do feelings, then baby, if you willing
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart without a sound
Girl, it oughta be a crime
I've fought in some bars
Broken some hearts
Ain't never done nothing this bad
Yeah, with one look at me
You became my disease
They don't make no cure for that
And I just wanna spin you around and 'round this dance floor
Get you drunk on a love like mine
Might wind up and steal a couple kisses
Get your digits if I can find the right line
But if you don't do feelings, then baby, if you willing
I'ma do my best to change your mind
'Cause the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart
Yeah, the way you stole my heart without a sound
Girl, it oughta be a crime
I just wanna spin you 'round tonight
(Spin you 'round and 'round this dance floor)
I just wanna spin you 'round tonight

I'd turn you 'round
If I was your radio

Keep you drinking, get you thinking
I'm right where you need to be
If I was your bartender

If I was your bed
I'd be ice-cold without me in it

Hanging outside that bar
Should've said "Go home
If you know what's good for your heart"
When she sat down
In that ADPi t-shirt
Should've said "Watch out
And boy, you're gonna wind up hurt"
And that label on that whiskey on that shelf
Should've said "Don't buy no shots for no one else"
Should've come with a warnin' (ooh)
Don't sit right there
Don't sip on what they're pouring (you)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the morning
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' (ooh)
Should've come with a warnin'
Phone just lit up
And it's damn near 2AM
Oughta be blue lights, or some kind of loud sirens
Sayin', "Don't pick it up, she'll let you down"
It's the deep end and you're gonna drown
And this "You up?" text that she sent me right now
Should've come with a warnin' (ooh)
Don't sit right there
Don't sip on what they're pouring (you)
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the morning
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Should've come with a warnin'
Don't fire it up, and hit the headlights
Turn on around at the next red light
I wish somebody would've gave me some damn signs
Yeah, I wish that night 
Would've come with a warnin' (ooh, ooh-ooh)

Would've come with a warnin' (ooh, ooh-ooh)

I don't know where the hell it comes from
Got no idea where it goes when it leaves
And when it's here, it's here, and when it's gone, it's gone
Kinda like them smoky mountain fall time trees
I guess I'll leave it to somethin' bigger to figure it all out
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why, it does to her what it does to dust
Really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
She sits there like a feather just waitin' on a gale
By the time I pushed off, she already caught sail
I'm always waitin' to put my anchor down
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why, it does to her what it does to dust
Really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
Hey, I can taste the rain, I can see the sun
And that makes sense to me
But this feels like one I that I can't outrun
Guess I'm runnin' just to see
If anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why, it does to her what it does to dust
Really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
And why it always takes her with it
And leaves me hangin' on a limb
Just wonderin' 'bout the wind
Oh, wonderin' 'bout the wind

Was Friday after five, I got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
And I ain't been here long, but the bobbers in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down
We're just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bopping up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down
Here
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down
We're just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bopping up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down

Somebody pass that fifth of Camp this way
I'll turn it up, down, up, down, up, down

Head bopping up, down, up, down, up, down

TITLE: Neon Eyes
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
They started out blue like an East Tennessee June sky
Full of small-town innocence, guarded by a picket fence
Perfect 'til I drove by
You were lookin' for a way out and I was on my way
Girl, once you love a cowboy, you'll never be the same
I know right now you think this is it
But I'm gonna leave you with
Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on thе dance floor
Never rеally gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes
Right now, they're glowin' like the cigarette we just sparked
Oh, but I've seen this scene before like the lights on a liquor store
Pretty soon, they'll go dark
I know you're tired of all the same shit
That's why you think you want this
I can show you first-hand, girl, what you wish you should've missed
But if you won't take it from me
I guess you're gonna have to see through
Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes
Neon eyes
I don't wanna be the one to say I told you so
Just let me push you away before you get too close
I can't go and make up your mind
And I don't wanna be the reason behind those
Neon eyes
Dollar-in-a-jukebox heartache
Drinkin' off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave you with neon eyes
Dancin' with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sippin' on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see you with neon eyes

Ahh yeah
There's some days that I wake up, can't remember where I am
Said some things, regret some things, but I really don't give a damn
Somewhere on this road I'm on, I forgot what it's like to feel
I know I can't see Heaven up there, but I know that it's real
And I ain't sure If I'll get in, but you best believe I'll try, yeah
And this is what my daddy told me, and this is how I live my life
Got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way, no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
Yeah, that's what he did
I can't heal the broken hearts, I left so far behind
On this road I have chose, I lost all sense of time
So I drift into the night tryna drown away my sorrows
It might be wrong, but that's alright 'cause all the time is borrowed anyways
Got to take that ball cap off before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way, no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
Some call me lost, some call me crazy
But that's okay
Think what you want, say what you will
But I've always kept it real
There's a cost for all these sins, and I'm bound to pay the price
Now this is what my daddy told me, and that's how I live my life
Got to take that ball cap off, son, before you say grace
And always own up to your own mistakes
And don't you ever back down, no way, no how
Got to make your daddy proud that he raised a man of the south
A man of the south
Ahh, take it away boys
Better take that ball cap off son

TITLE: The Way I Talk
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up 
Something in it, them California girls love 
Some people like to make a little fun of 
The way I talk
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it, them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheering on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man, it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact, I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

TITLE: Need A Boat
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
This whiskey sure tastes fine right now
But it ain't doing the trick, no
Yeah, it ain't getting me gone enough
To make my mind forget
That one shot, two shot, three shot more
Don't change the fact
She ain't in the picture any more
This bar stool ain't working
But if anything can
It'll be me on a dock pushin' off of dry land
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feeling
Praying to the Man for some muddy water healing
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burning up some black smoke, down a back road
I need a boat
I need a boat
Don't care if it's a pontoon
Brand new, been used
As long as it'll fish
Just wanna cast it out yonder
Let my mind wander off to anything but this
I'm tired of running into all my friends
Asking if I'm over her loving
Yeah, but out there where the river lets in
Them fish don't ask me nothing
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feeling
Praying to the Man for some muddy water healing
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burning up some black smoke, down a back road
I need a boat
I need a boat
I need some peace and quiet
I don't know who the hell is gonna buy it
Yeah, but I need a boat
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feeling
Praying to the Man for some muddy water healing
Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burning up some black smoke, down a back road
I need a boat
I need a boat
I need a boat
I need a boat
Real, real bad

TITLE: Whatcha Think Of Country Now
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
When I met you, I was chillin' to some old Willie
Bet you were thinking, "How'd I get up with this hillbilly?"
Saw yourself sitting pretty in the big city
And now you're big-time digging on some little bitty
Back roads, real slow
Got your hand out the window
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, "It's gonna be awhile, " ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?
Oh, baby now you've seen the way my sun sets
From a blanket on a bank of a creek bed
And I can tell you were hooked soon as you said
"Don't take me home, boy, I ain't had enough yet"
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, "It's gonna be awhile, " ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think about the pine trees?
Hey, whatcha think about the cool breeze?
And whatcha think about the midnight moon?
Oh, damn, this country looks good on you
Now you took a little ride around the farm
Got to do a little fishing in the dark
Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Halfway down your first country mile
You called your mama said, "It's gonna be awhile, " ha
Didn't think way out was your style
But now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
Yeah, whatcha think of country now?
Oh, baby, whatcha think of country now?

ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets to burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone, and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days
I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen
To my head in these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days
I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorrys' I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew, all them days
I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you

LYRICS:
They say you need a couple credits 'fore they'll let you out of college 
I bet you bought that beer with you daddy's card 
You're looking like you probably get a little tired of all this 
Attention that you're getting when you go to the bar
They say you need a couple credits 'fore they'll let you out of college
I bet you bought that beer with you daddy's card
You're looking like you probably get a little tired of all this
Attention that you're getting when you go to the bar
We can take a different route
I know you're from a different town
But you're here for now
So whatcha say we get on out and see where this night leads?
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a-quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommates home
Honey, when the sun come peaking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me
If I know me
This ain't some routine that I use every Friday
This ain't a one line, one night kiss and tell
But ever since I caught you looking over my way
All that I could do was tell myself
If I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a-quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommates home
Honey, when the sun come peaking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me
If I know me, if I know me
And I could just change my mind and leave my number in your phone
And give you a kiss goodnight and go home alone
But if I know me, I'll have you hopping up in my passenger seat
Then I take you home you ain't gonna wanna leave
Make a little love at a-quarter past three
Gotta keep it down 'cause your roommates home
Honey, when the sun come peaking through the trees
You ain't gotta worry 'bout what it might be
'Cause I bet it won't be the last time you're waking up next to me

Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on

With someone new

If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialling no more at 3 am
"Mr bartender hittin' me again"

Leave a 20 for the band
If they'll lay off lonesome songs tonight

Make it quick and make it strong

TITLE: Chasin' You
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
We used to chase that Chattanooga fray
Couple a kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple lamp
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now, what I was doing then
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
You always used to talk about L.A
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Oh wait, you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as guitar town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know better
Haven't given' up, I'm just on your radio
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you
Chasing you, like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasing you, like those goodbye taillights
Heading west to anywhere out of this no where town
Chasing that freedom, chasing that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasing that you and me, I only see in my rear view
Hell, I'm laying every night holding someone new
Still chasing you, still chasing you

If you get a little dirt on your new boots
If you roll in late to work from hittin' snooze
If them school boys ain't got no luck
'Cause you start turnin' your nose up
At them downtown lights, 'cause they ain't your kind of view
Hope the next boy that falls for you don't blame you
If you roll your eyes when them other guys
Try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine, and you start liking shooting whiskey
If you start talking with a drawl and feeling all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Oh baby, blame it on me
Baby, blame it on me
If your friends start asking you what's going on
'Cause all you wanna hear is them country songs
If you start takin' gravel roads and stopping off at Texacos
And you wanna watch the full moon all night long, it's my fault, ha
If you roll your eyes when them other guys
Try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine, and you start liking shooting whiskey
If you start talking with a drawl and feeling all kinds of pretty
If you're up to see the sun before you fall asleep
Oh baby, blame it on me
Baby, blame it on me
Forgive me if I set the bar too high
With a six-pack and a bass boat fishtail slide
If them weekend boys get boring, I don't mean to wreck it for you
Yeah, it's my bad girl if you had the time of your life
It's all right
If you roll your eyes when them other guys
Try to take you out on the city
If you quit sippin' wine, and you start liking shooting whiskey
If you start talking with a drawl and feeling all kinds of pretty

Jack D, there's a seven on the label
One glass on the living room table
Phone face down, church up loud
Was tryna drown you out tonight but
First sip, I could feel you on my shoulder
The Tennessee heat had me feelin' colder
Thought a drink would get you off my mind
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021), yeah
One last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call, and I tried
But this bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021)
You might think I don't really want you with me
You might tell me to empty out my whiskey
Or try changin' what I'm holdin' in my hand
Try another liquor, try another brand but
It don't matter if I got my lips
On a different drink, on a different night
Yeah, the second that I take a sip, all I'm gonna think is
This bottle tastes like 865 (409-1021), yeah
One last time, don't think twice
Girl, just pick it up and come over
Give the bedroom door a little closure
I know I told you I wouldn't call, and I tried

She's my yin yang girl, she's day she's night
Just a shot in the dark, she's a beam of light
She's a hot contradiction, a brand new addiction
Like to sip that wine when I take her out fishin'
She's the last one there when they close the bar
Got mud on the tires of her fancy car
She's a real good girl 'til she's had a few
Likes church on a Sunday, sits in the back pew
If the preacher only knew the man
She's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint
She's my yin yang girl
Yeah, she's an angel who can raise a little hell
She's a daddy's little girl, she can do no wrong
But I hope he never sees her camera phone
She's a real home maker, a whiskey shot taker
A bed time story and a midnight shaker
Shake it babe
And man, she's an angel who can raise a little hell
A drive fast, high class southern belle
She's crazy, there ain't no doubt about it
She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit a sinner, and a little bit a saint

She's a rock star dancin' on the tailgate
A little bit of Skynyrd, and a little bit a Hank

I went off the rails
Thought hell, might as well
Rock bottom was callin' my name
But lookin' back now, I oughta be
In the movin' on hall-of-fame
It wasn't my buddies
It wasn't my mama
It wasn't, no self-help how-to
It wasn't old records
It wasn't old flings
Or dancin' with somebody new
Tequila made me crazy
Cold beer wouldn't do
So I whiskey'd my way over you
You saw me out on a Friday downtown
With a smile that came stumblin' back in
Guess that killed your mood 'cause you did what you do
Turned around and walked out again
So pour a little more bourbon
Oh, it's the only thing been workin'
It wasn't my buddies

TITLE: 7 Summers
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Yeah, you used to talk about
Gettin' even further south
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder when you're drinkin'
If you find yourself thinkin'
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke
And Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger?
Who knows
Back then you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Thinks she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way, anyway
But I wonder when you're drinkin'
If you find yourself thinkin'
About that boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers of Coke
And Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger?
Who knows
Back then you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me

Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

If I ever get you back I'mma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back 
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
I see you dancing with Mr. Handsome
He looks like he's a real romancer
I'm just hoping and I'm praying 
that one day I hear you saying
That you gon' give me that second chance and take me back
And we gon' roll through life in a Cadillac
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back 
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
No I ain't
I'll buy you flowers, talk for hours
Write your name up on the water tower
Keep you covered up in diamonds
Make your smile light up just like 'em
I'm gon' "Yes M'am" you "No M'am" you, open up your door
and I'mma give you all my heart and a whole lot more
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back 
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time
I'm gonna "Yes M'am" you "No M'am" you, open up your door
and I'mma give you all my heart and a whole lot more
If I ever get you back I'ma treat you like a queen
Make a livin' lovin' you, a lot of kissin' in between
I'll be looking for a reason just to please you
That's the world that you'll be living in
Girl, if I ever get you back 
I ain't gon' ever have to get you back again
Not this time, no

TITLE: Outlaw
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Used to be you'd see my face, on wanted posters all over this town, um
For leading lovers on until the dawn just ridin' in and rollin' out, um
I never thought I'd get caught
Yeah, at least that's what I thought
'Til you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazin'
Bang-bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang-bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightnin', ain't tryna fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth?
Guess that makes you an outlaw too
I can't believe you came after me
With the crazy reputation that I have
It takes a hell of an angel
To see the good inside a man so bad
But you did
I never thought I'd get caught
Yeah, at least that's what I thought
'Til you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazin'
Bang-bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang-bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightnin', ain't tryna fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth?
Guess that makes you an outlaw too
Yes, it does, baby
I was wild as a West Texas wind
Wild as a cowboy's ever been
'Til you rolled in like Annie Oakley with them guns blazin'
Bang-bang, baby, them blue eyes got me like
Take me in, lock me up, tell all them boys not to save me
Bang-bang, baby, that sweet smile hit me like
Lightnin', ain't tryna fight it
Stole this heart, ain't that the truth?
Guess that makes you an outlaw too

TITLE: The Way I Talk
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up 
Something in it, them California girls love 
Some people like to make a little fun of 
The way I talk
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it, them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheering on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man, it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now
Fighting words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact, I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
I sound a little bit like my daddy
I don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi rolls
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
The way I talk

I could see me sittin' in the back of 
A cop car bangin' my head on a window 
I could see me slammin' that last call 
Shot glass, losin' everything in my billfold

A cop car bangin' my head on a window

'Cause that could be dangerous

With a daisy duke dime, but I don't see it lastin' long

TITLE: This Side Of A Dust Cloud
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I put the same pedal down on the same metal
Slung the same gravel goodbye high
I burned the same bridges up with the same finger up
She got out the driver's side
So I know what never comin' back looks like
Looks like she ain't ever comin' back
It's usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around, and here I am now
On this side of a dust cloud
She's burnin' unleaded and my own medicine
Tastes more bitter than sweet
Her tires are turnin', and the tables are too
Never seen a broken heart from this point of view
It's usually me doing the leaving, me doing the running
I don't know where she's going
But I know a little something 'bout
Smokin' up them Goodyears
To know that it ain't lookin' good here for the home crowd
Guess she beat me at my own game
Thing about a two-lane, guess it's gotta work both ways
What goes around, comes around, came around, and here I am now

Never thought I'd be calling you up today
Taking out an ad for this Chevrolet
But there's a ring in the window just down the street
I wanna marry her, she wants to marry me
Money's kinda tight but love don't care
Me and this truck been everywhere

Workin' hard all summer, just like I did?

And when he reads these words right here

Sittin' right beside you when you're ridin' around

LYRICS:
That DJ on the side stage ain't played one song I like
It's all craft beer served in here, can't even get a cold Bud Light
I see you sittin' over there barely sippin' your drink
Lookin' like you might need a little scenery change
Got a spot I've been hittin' since back in the day
What ya say we slip away and say to hell with this place?
And go get a little gone girl on the black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, the moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl
Gone like that six pack, we gonna tip back on my hood
Gone like our Levis, gonna hang 'em on an old dogwood
Yeah the thought of you and me in the back forty
With the trees and the bees and the birds
Can't think of nothin' better but baby no pressure
Really all you gotta do is say the word
We can get a little gone girl on the black Jack label
In the middle of a dirt road dance floor
Way out, nobody in our business
Just us and the crickets and the good Lord
Stars gonna burn on out, the moon gonna sneak on down
We could have a hell of a time, I'll get to makin' you mine
With the rest of what's left of the night, 'til it's gone girl

Roll 'til we find a little heaven on Earth

Take a few backroad curves, yeah 'til it's gone girl
Find a little heaven on Earth, 'til it's gone girl

TITLE: More Than My Hometown
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more

TITLE: Sand In My Boots
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
She asked me where I was from
I said "Somewhere you never been to"
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headed right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said "Don't cowboy's drink whiskey?" huh
So we drank bottom shelf
She said "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said, "Girl you've never seen stars like the ones back home"
And she said "Maybe I should see them for myself"
Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headed right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said "Meet me in the mornin'"
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up
Ah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headed right back to my roots
Somethin' bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

TITLE: This Bar
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I found myself in this bar
Making mistakes and making new friends
I was growing up and nothing made sense
Buzzing all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this
Couldn't wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spinnin' round dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer
I found myself in this bar
Making mistakes and making new friends
I was growing up and nothing made sense
Buzzing all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this
Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit it off
Year down the road, I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
We had it good and it hurt so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round
I found myself in this bar
Making mistakes and making new friends
I was growing up and nothing made sense
Learning how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Lights and kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was looking for
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain't it strange the things you keep tucked in your heart?
I found myself in this bar

Blue ribbon bottles, big block throttles
Marlboros if you want 'em
Go on and take a drag
A little small town freedom
A little taste of dreamin'
No need to preach
No need to shout, we believe in
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
Faded Levi's, worn out Chucks
20 in my pocket, feels like a million bucks
Blue-eyed beauty, lean in to me
Our own show in the back row
Miss the whole damn movie
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
American nights
American nights
American nights
Pray the morning don't come
These colors don't run
Stay up and stay young
American nights
American nights, wanted alive
Cuttin' down Main St. in the dark
Muscle shoals, muscle cars
Earnin' our stripes underneath these stars
American nights
American nights
American nights
Pray the mornin' don't come
Stay up and stay young

TITLE: Cover Me Up
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
A heart on the run 
Keeps a hand on a gun
You can't trust anyone
I was so sure 
What I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
I put your faith to the test 
When I tore off your dress
In Richmond on high
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
"I thought it'd be me who helped him get home"
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along
So girl, hang your dress out to dry
We ain't leaving this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide
And the river runs through
And carries this house on its stones
Like a piece of driftwood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good
So girl, leave your boots by the bed
We ain't leaving this room
'Til someone needs medical help
Or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough
To use me for good

TITLE: Still Goin Down
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks a back road gets old
But for me, it just can't
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cut offs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Ain't breakin' ground
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cut offs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar

So go on and call me crazy

I rolled in bumpin' 10's into Broadway
Dirty boots, been a working like a dog day
I'm boot scootin' to the duke for some Conway
Or anything to get my Honky Tonk on
You walked in, cut-offs looking real skimpy
The hottest thing my side of the Mississippi
And I could spin you 'round and 'round 'til I get you dizzy
But you look like you got hillbilly in your bones
So let's ditch this hole in the wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't saying that you wanna but if it's any consolation
I got a red neck, yes I do, I got a red neck, how 'bout you?
I got a four by four with a toolbox just to keep them ol' mountains blue
You got a drank, you're barely sipping, I got a tank full of pay cheque money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon, girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?
I'll close the tab quick, we can go get half-lit
Hit the river skinny dip or catch a catfish
Yeah, I'll take you to the howler, I ain't talking 'bout a hollow
Put some red on the tread, hell, I'll wash it off tomorrow
Let's ditch this hole in the wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't saying that you wanna but if it's any consolation
I got a red neck, yes I do, I got a red neck, how 'bout you?
I got a four by four with a toolbox just to keep them ol' mountains blue
You got a drank, you're barely sipping, I got a tank full of pay cheque money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon, girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?
Whatcha say? Whatcha say?
We can take a little stroll, maybe roll in some hay
What's it gon' be? What's it gon' be?
Shorty, if you wanna get your Back Forty on with me
Then let's ditch this hole in the wall
Mix some sticks with a fifth of homemade alcohol
Disappear somewhere with a lower population
I ain't saying that you wanna but if it's any consolation
I got a red neck, yes I do, I got a red neck, how 'bout you?
I got a four by four with a toolbox just to keep them ol' mountains blue
You got a drank, you're barely sipping, I got a tank full of pay cheque money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon, girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?

TITLE: Whiskey Glasses
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Pour me, pour me another drink
'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing
No more, hell nah
I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
Pour me, pour me another round
Line 'em up and knock 'em down
Two more let's go
'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Last call
I swear this will be my last call
Now I ain't drunk dialling no more at 3 am
"Mr bartender hittin' me again"
Don't wanna think about her
Or wear a ring without her
Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
Can't sing without her
So make them drinks strong
'Cause brother she's gone
And if I'm ever gonna move on
I'ma need some whiskey glasses
'Cause I don't wanna see the truth
She's probably making out on the couch right now
With someone new
Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
If I'm gonna make it through
If I'ma be single
I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
And see the world through whiskey glasses
(Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
Oh, see the world through whiskey glasses
(I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
Line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up, line 'em up
Knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back, knock 'em back
Fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up, fill 'em up
'Cause if she ain't ever coming back
I'ma need some whiskey glasses

TITLE: Somebody's Problem
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
A 'bama red four-runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still
Oh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines, and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
Shе's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't leave it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines, and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
About to be mine
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines, and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes

TITLE: Happy Hour
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Looking back I see a million little things that wrecked us
She never liked my pick up truck
Parked up beside her Lexus
And I never wore them khaki's like she asked me
Just trashy old blue jeans
Old skoal ring
She packed up her Chanel
Said 'go to hell', taught me a lesson
And now as far as she's concerned
I'm in a deep and dark depression
But it's happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went
And hooked me up with some Willie
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah
And I know she'll hear about my 'paint the town red' gallivanting
And she'll think I thought of her curves
When I found that gal to dance with
And she'll tell her friends I'm faking, my hearts breaking,
Time will take away my grin
But I'm winning every bar I stumble in
But it's happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went
And hooked me up with some Willy
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah
Well it'll make her feel much better if she thinks my life is hell
Tell her every since she left me its like time is standing still
And it's happy hour drinking double shooters
Buying whiskey sours for a pack of cougars
I know I should be sadder but it all seems silly
'Cause my good buddy went
And hooked me up with some Willy
Girl, I know a breakup ain't supposed to be fun
But I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done
Yeah, I'm here at happy hour, happy ours is done, yeah

LYRICS:
It don't matter if we're out under New York lights
Or taking in the scene on Ocean Drive
Or standing underneath that Hollywood sign
In California
I always seem to miss it all
I can't focus, I get lost
And I think you know it's all your fault
Now baby, don't ya?
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm up
Girl you don't need stilettos
To turn them heads around
You ain't gotta worry 'bout getting lost in the crowd
Oh, baby, you're a stand out (You know I get so elevated)
Oh, there ain't no doubt (You ain't routine, so far from basic)
I wanna find a club, and wanna show you off
When we roll in, it won't take long
Every guy with a girl, yeah, they gonna take caught
Looking
And I can't blame 'em
And girl, you look famous
If I was in their shoes
I'd do the same, 'cause-
You end up winning, baby
I can't just take one look
Everything around you fades to black
And just like that, I'm up

TITLE: Bandaid On A Bullet Hole
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
Girl, since you left me
Been tryin' to forget we
Ever became what we were
And I poured some whiskey
On places you kissed me
Tried to wash off all the hurt
But ain't nothin' workin'
I've lived out the words in
A thousand old sad country songs
But whenever I try to move on
It's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers, told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
If I was only
Heartbroke and lonely
I'd head on back down to the bar
Find me a companion
But you left a canyon
Can't nobody fill in this heart
And girl, it's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
And I've held some strangers, told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
No damn good, damn good, damn good at all
And baby, tell me how you did it?
I just gotta know
And tell me what's your secret?
And how'd you let me go so easy?
'Cause girl, it's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole
Tryna tell a cowboy to slow down
It's like watchin' the way that the river rolls
And then tellin' it to turn back around
Oh, I've held some strangers, told people I hate you
But I just keep hittin' a wall
It's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole
It just don't do me no good at all
It's like tryna put a Band-Aid on a bullet hole

TITLE: More Surprised Than Me
ARTIST: Morgan Wallen
LYRICS:
I bought a Harvard sweatshirt off the Goodwill rack
Makes some people wonder if I'm smart like that
And that guitar layin' on the chair is worn out like my boots
Makes it look like I can play it better than I do
But nobody buys it when we walk in 
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
It's funny how some strangers like to size me up
This attitude it makes me street and this accent makes me dumb
I can tell 'em I've got pirate blood or ancient royalty
There's no end to the lies that I could get 'em to believe
But nobody buys it when we walk in 
They say there ain't no way that she's with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
Must of done somethin' right, somethin' right
In another life
'Cause nobody buys it when we walk in 
They say there ain't no way that she could be with him
In a world where nothing is what it seems
Ain't no one more surprised than me
Oh, ain't no one more surprised than me

LYRICS:
I don't wanna go to work
I don't wanna see my ex-girl
I don't wanna worry 'bout finding me my next girlfriend
At the bar where they charge your right arm for a cold can of PBR
Yeah, I don't wanna watch the news
I don't wanna pick the phone up
Don't wanna sit in traffic with an empty can of long cut
I've been doin' what I should be doin' 
and I'm losin' my Dodge Ram mind
'Cause I just wanna do country ass shit
With my country ass friends
With my country ass band
Havin' to make them dollar bills y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels y'all
Between workin' it off
And gettin' it chewed
They ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass
Goin' fishin'
Yeah I just wanna drink a beer
I just wanna get a line wet
Let the sun put some more red on my neck
Wave at the girls on their rental pontoons
While my bass boat speakers go boom, boom
'Cause I just wanna do country ass shit
With my country ass friends
With my country ass band
Havin' to make them dollar bills y'all
Ask me how my country ass feels y'all
Between workin' it off
And gettin' it chewed
They ain't much country ass left in these old blue jeans
But wait a minute, the whole world can kiss it
'Cause me and my country ass

Don't wanna shake no hands or tuck my shirt in

Ask me how my country ass feels y'all

Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah 
But mama still prays for me 
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world 
Through a window from A to B
Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah
But mama still prays for me
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world
Through a window from A to B
Between alcohol and women and Aderall and adrenaline
I don't ever get no rest
Sign my life away to be the life of the party
Yeah, to everybody else
I look like a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' the dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Another day, another venue
There's trouble to get into
And love ain't on the menu again
Lonely as an eagle
I meet a thousand people
Who think I got a thousand friends
Ooh
There's a stranger in the mirror
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
But accordin' to the pictures
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars

Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life

TITLE: Memories Are Made Of
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Cheap boat six pack of something light
A fireball burning up the blue sky
Mercury 93 wasn't even half past noon
Our first taste of freedom after high school
Breaking hearts and curfews and mama's rules
I just laugh thinking 'bout all the shit that we got into to
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose
But we did
And we miss
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn't much but it's what we had
Just a couple Buds and a good buzz is all it was
But that's what memories are made of
It's been so long since me and Katie first met
We lost touch and as of all the years went
Flying past, fading fast
Wishing that I could making her mine
There are some things that seem to take you right back
I see her face
Every time I hear that
Lynyrd Skynyrd, bottle spin
I'm in her arms in my mind
Yeah those were the days we thought we never lose (never lose)
But we did
And we missed
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn't much but it's we had
Just a good buzz from a summer love was all it was
Yeah that's what memories are made of
Yeah those were the days we thought we'd never lose
But we did
And we missed
How it was when we were just kids
Looking back
On the past
Wasn't much but it's we had
Just a couple Buds and a good buzz was all it was
Yeah summer love was all it was
But that's what memories are made of

TITLE: Does To Me
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get luck
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I will never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
There's a worn-out blade that my Granddaddy gave me
My Mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me (Yeah, it does to me)
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me

Honey, how's that drink goin' down
Seems a little still for 2 P.M
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' lines
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime, think on this
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Bean
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Girl, you ain't in this thing alone
Oh no, oh no
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
No, you're not the only lonely one

Just pick yourself up
Dust yourself off
They say it ain't that hard
But just puttin' one foot 
In front of the other 
Ain't gettin' me too far
This movin' on ain't comin' along 
The way they said it would
I guess whoever said the grass is greener 
Must have never seen the other side
What don't kill you makes you stronger 
Sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that time heals everything 
And everything will be alright?
Whoever said it ain't the end of the world
You can find somebody new
Must've never met you
Must've never heard you say 
You'd never leave me
Then watch you walk away
Must've never fell as hard as I did 
'Cause then they wouldn't say
Maybe we weren't meant to be 
And maybe you're better off alone
I guess whoever said the grass is greener 
Must've never seen the other side
What don't kill you makes you stronger 
Sure sounds like a lie
And whoever said that time heals everything 
And everything will be alright?
Whoever said it ain't the end of the world
You can find somebody new
Must've never met you
Must've never met you
Maybe we weren't meant to be 
And maybe you're better off alone
Whoever said the grass is greener

Still sounds like a lie

Hope you've been well
Me, I'm doin' alright
Could always be better
Seeing as you're the only one with a choice in the matter
If I know you, hell, you're too busy
To do damn near anything that you ought to
Guess what I'm sayin' is, is if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days
So maybe you should call our mama
Have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time
And put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted
Like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I've got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, tomorrow
Listen, I ain't tryin' to bring you down
'Cause I know damn better than pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out for you and me both
'Cause we both lose if I told you so
So maybe you should call our mama
Have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time
And put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted
Like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down

TITLE: Moon Over Mexico

LYRICS:
I can still see your blue sky
Blue eyes hanging on a mango kiss
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees
Was just about as good as it gets
Taste the salt on the rim, feel that sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind like I'm right there again
Under a moon over Mexico
Holding onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
The second I left I was kicking myself
'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us waking up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow
Of a moon over Mexico
Holding onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
Taste the salt on the rim
Feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind
Like I'm right there again
Under a moon over Mexico (Mexico)
Holding onto you as the low tide rolls (As the low tide rolls)
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico (Pacifico)
Under a moon over Mexico
Under a moon over Mexico

It's been a long night with a heavy load
But now my high beams are shinin' on my babies road
Gonna pick up some clay on the tread of these tires
Have ourselves a hell of a night
Look up in that Carolina sky
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine
It's been a long time since we felt that creek
Runnin' cold and clear over our bare feet
Baby, you don't know that this right here
Is the same water my ol' man used in his still
I still remember what he used to say
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
So let the moonshine
It burns me up and lights a fire in my soul
We'll get you a sip and let the whiskey take control
Let that moonshine, all night, take your breath away
Like an old sweet song daddy used to play
And it takes me back to a simpler place and time
When we used to kick back
And let the moonshine
Just let the moonshine
And let the moonshine

TITLE: Sheriff You Want To
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Well me and my buddies
Went sneaking out
About 2a.m.
To go and catch us a trout
And that's when
I saw that car pull up
He said
"Boys, I don't care that you're way out here
But you look a little young
For all that beer"
And when he got close
I couldn't tell who that was
He said
"I ain't the cops
I ain't your parents
Boys, you're dealing with the county sheriff"
So I said
We can share if you want to
So buddy won't you
Take a sip and help us finish it tonight
I ain't giving you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
And just a little bit
Will have you feeling just right
So dude
We can share if you want to
Me and the boys
Sneaking out again
A quick turnaround
It was the next weekend
We had the single cab
All filled up with smoke
He came up quick and tapped on the glass
I dropped that joint and sat up real fast
And when I saw who it was
Damn I almost choked
Well it wasn't the cops
It wasn't our parents
It was our old friend
The county sheriff
So I said
We can share if you want to
So buddy won't you
Take a hit and help us finish it tonight
I ain't giving you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
And just a little bit
Will have you feeling just right
So dude
We can share if you want to
Well we got off both times
Even though it crossed that line
And you can too
'Cause all you have to do
Is say
We can share if you want to
So buddy won't you
Take a sip and help us finish it tonight
I ain't giving you an attitude
But I can tell you're in a bad mood
And just a little bit
Will have you feeling just right
So dude
We can share if you want to
We can share if you want to

TITLE: One Number Away
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Are you sitting at home all alone
Trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone
Praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen
A thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer
Getting lost in your favorite lines?
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a
Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror
Get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station
Replacing our favorite song?
Well, maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all?
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away from calling you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, "I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, anything I want to say
But I'm still one number away
Away
Away
Yeah, I'm still one number away

TITLE: She Got The Best Of Me
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancin' around a fire
But you're in it
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beatin' in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
I picked myself up off the floor
And found somethin' new worth livin' for
In an old dusty hand-me-down six string
And a couple chords
I'm gettin' over her
A little more with every song
So y'all sing along
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beatin' in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

She broke my heart

TITLE: Reasons
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sunday
Or an ice-cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at 18 Mama gave me a curfew
But it was, "Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules"
I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
But some of them I'll never understand
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts, I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts, I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons
Some are good and some are bad
Some are true and some are sad
Everyone's got some but I need one
That brings you back
We all got our reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life, and you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts, I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons
Woah, I got my reasons
Yeah, I got my reasons

TITLE: Ever Mine
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
My dearest darling, I miss you more than words can tell
I hope the garden's growing tall
You're in good spirits and good health
We've traveled far now, with a long way to go still
I know not yet when I'll return or if I ever will
Each day grows colder, filled with powder, smoke and steel
I worry 'fore it's over I'll forgotten how to feel
I keep your picture in the pocket of my coat
I sometimes find when I'm alone it's my last bit of hope
Amidst the grips of these troubled times
A way back to you, I always find
You're the wind that whispers through the pines
Bloom in the rose, green on the vine
Until we meet again my love sincerely signed
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine
Some of these boys aren't much older than our own
They fight like men and then get cut down before they're grown
This is my prayer
That our daughter and our sons wrap their arms around each other
And never around a gun
Amidst the grips of these troubled times
A way back to you, I'll always find
You're the wind that whispers through the pines
Bloom in the rose, green on the vine
Until we meet again my love sincerely signed
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine
If you should hear it's come my time
A way back to you, I'll always find
I'll be the wind that whispers through the pines
Pitch in the black, star in the shine
We'll meet again on the other side
I'm ever yours, you're ever mine

Way down where the sun shines hotter
Dog's on the porch
Gator's in the water
Way down, down in Alabama
Muddy Mississippi
Swampy Louisiana
We come up a little different 'round here
We got a little dirt road dust runnin' through our blood
From a "Never heard of it" hometown
I got a can't quit heart and some take it too far
And a whole lot of never back down
If you come around here, better bring it 'cause we're no doubt
Gonna put a little south on ya
We hold it down from Texas to Missouri
From the Arkansas hollers
And the grass in Kentucky
To the blue skies in Carolina
Florida, Tennessee, and Georgia
Come and find us
Man, we got it made down here
We got a little dirt road dust runnin' through our blood

TITLE: We Still Drink Beer
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
If you drove by my drive on a Saturday 
You'd see us popping tops in the cedar shade 
No matter when or where it's what we do
You could take us out to Napa with the finest wines 
Dress us up in Armani suits and ties 
But the iced down, small town, blue collar cold hard truth is
We'd still drink beer 
We'd still get loud 
We'd still turn 'em up catch us a buzz while the sun goes down 
'Til every last drop in the world is gone 
Or the good Lord calls us home 
Long as we're down here 
We still drink beer 
You can shoot us to the the moon in a rocket ship 
And we'd be in as long as we could fit 
A cooler in the back packed down with lunar light 
When they put us on the 5 o'clock news that day 
Ask us if there's anything we wanna say 
One small sip for man 
Cold cans for all mankind
And we'd still drink beer 
We'd still get loud 
We'd still turn 'em up catch us a buzz while the sun goes down (yeah)
'Til every last drop in the world is gone 
Or the good Lord calls us home 
Long as we're down here 
We still drink beer (yeah, we would)
And we'd still drink beer 
We'd still get loud 
We'd still turn 'em up catch us a buzz while the sun goes down 
'Til every last drop in the world is gone 
Or the good Lord calls us home 
Long as we're down here 
We still drink beer 
Long as we're down here
We'd still drink beer

TITLE: All Over Again
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Feels so familiar
You walking in here
Wearing just what you know makes me weak
And I'm already ordering you a drink
Baby, and then we're
Gonna get out of here
Just like the last time and the time before
We're at your house and through the door
And we're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn, "I love you"
Into, "Boy, where you been?"
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again
I think you're out of my system
At least 'til I miss ya
I'll start going through withdrawals
That's about the time you'll call
And we'll be falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn, "I love you"
Into, "Boy, where you been?"
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again
Well, I know where we'll wind up
'Cause trouble loves to find us
And I guess goodbye's just too tough
'Cause last time was the last time, but
We're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn, "I love you"
Into, "Boy, where you been?"

Say "it's good to see ya brother, man how you been?"
I can't complain, I'm doin' alright
Sleepin' pretty good, staying dry
Thank the Lord every mornin' with a sweet Amen 
For how far I've come from, how far I've been
So here's too good days, where I've been
So here's to good days, better tomorrows
And a light at the end of the bottle
Some battles are fought on foreign shores
Some are fought behind closed doors
Some fall from grace, some lose their wings
Some find the peace salvation brings

Headin' down to Alabama

Headlights, wide lines
Flying down 65
Tryna catch a few hours sleep
Tomorrow comes, show time
That's when I know I'm 
Living that neon dream
Oh I got the boys
And the band
And a one night stand
Waiting on us down the road
We're gonna load it in
Crank it to 10
Whiskey shots at 2AM
And off to another show
And then it's back to my baby for
A couple days
But I can only stay for so long
'Til that Honky Talk Highway's calling me home
Rolling into Mobile
Name on the marquee sign
Waving at the women that are standing in the ticket line
Well point me to the stage
I know that's the only place I'm ever gonna wanna be
Smoky bars, guitars
Breakin' all the girls hearts
That's the only life for me

There's daddy on his John Deere, brand new in '96
Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid
A save-the-date, best day of my best buddy's life
Anybody else could walk on by, and not blink an eye
'Cause they're just pictures hangin' side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
Just the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door
My first day in kindergarten when I was 5 years old
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico
A list of what mama needs from the IGA today
It's just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98
With all those pictures hangin' side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door
As life flies by, it spills onto the side
Until it's covered top to bottom with the best days of your life
And all those pictures hangin' side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that you've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's our lives on the 'frigerator door

Well I got a call from Riley 'round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hanker for a honkey tonk
Wants an ice-cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well, I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stopping me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open
The ticktock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past ten, I'm half past tipsy
At quarter to 12, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hit me
Five, four, three, two, one, too many
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, "Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?"
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand, man I'm wide ass open

At quarter to 12, man I've done had plenty
The countdown's on when the first beer hit me
Five, four, three, two, one, too many
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young
So what you say we shotgun one?
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'

TITLE: Six Feet Apart
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
When the dogwoods start to bloom
And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That I feel most alive
But the news has all been bad
And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Someday when we aren't six feet apart
First thing that I'm gonna do
Is slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
And buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ballgame from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Someday when we aren't six feet apart
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery I suppose

TITLE: Without You
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Dad sold every record he ever owned
Floyd and Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones
A lifetime of music gone just to get me through
Momma always had her a second job
Gone with the sun until six o'clock
Whatever it took to get by she was gonna do
Didn't dawn on me back then but now I see
That without them, I wouldn't be me
When I'm up here on this stage
The spotlight's on my face
But I see you
Sure it's me behind this mic stand
And it's me strumming this Gibson
It's me they love to give the credit to
But me don't mean a thing without you
You make sacrifices every night and day
Never hear the crowd scream your name
But there's a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through
I'd give it all up just to keep your love
But you wouldn't let me 'cause you care too much
About watching me watch my dreams all come true
When I'm up here on this stage
The spotlight's on my face
But I see you
Well sure it's me behind this mic stand
And it's me strumming this Gibson
It's me they love to give the credit to
But me don't mean a thing without you
You worked overtime to buy those tickets
The gas, the beer and the babysitters
Just to spend one night with your baby at a country show
Paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park
Got in line early to grab your spot
So you deserve every word, every line of your favorite tune
When I'm up here on this stage
The spotlight's on my face
But I see you
Well sure it's me behind this mic stand
And it's me strumming this Gibson
And it's me they love to give the credit to
I'm just trying to give the credit where credit's due
Because me don't mean a thing without you

LYRICS:
Her day starts with a coffee
And ends with a wine
Takes forever gettin' ready
So she's never on time for anything
When she gets that come-get-me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me
The way that she drives me wild
And she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend
Can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
And says, "Let's stay on the couch and watch TV"
And she falls asleep
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool
Yeah, I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful, crazy
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances
Ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy
She's crazy
She's crazy
But her crazy's beautiful to me
Her crazy's beautiful to me

I'm a puzzle 
I'm a walking contradiction 
In far from mint condition 
'Cause there's pieces I can't find
I'm a puzzle
I'm a walking contradiction
In far from mint condition
'Cause there's pieces I can't find
Sometimes trouble
A can of cope, a day addiction
With set in stone convictions
And a no bend bottom line
I'm an easy read but I ain't no open book
Got a knack for making things harder than they look
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess, be careful what you wish for
Is all I meant when I said
"What you see is what you get"
At least I'm honest
I don't spin it like a record
And I ain't acting like I'm better
Than you know I really am
Yeah, you're dead on it
You got me figured, I'll admit it
Set in my ways hard-headed
But hell, I do the best I can
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess, be careful what you wish for
Is all I meant when I said
"What you see is what you get"
With me ain't no tricks up these sleeves
An acquired taste, a constant work in progress
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess, be careful what you wish for
Is all I meant when I said
"What you see is what you get"
What you see is what you get

TITLE: Houston, We Got A Problem
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
This is my kinda town, this is my kinda place
I wouldn't mind hangin' 'round
For more than just a couple days
I got a twelfth floor room with a killer view of the empty Astrodome
A tab at the bar downstairs, but all I can think about is home
I got new boots covered in red dirt
A "Don't Mess With Texas" T-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with missin' you
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
You should've seen 19th Street, you should've seen a midnight rodeo
The way them saloon doors swing, when they line dance to "Copperhead Road"
Some like the lager down here, that'll make you feel the way all them cowboys do
I wish I was an outlaw,
But all I can think about is you
I got new boots covered in red dirt
A "Don't Mess With Texas" T-shirt
And a Lonestar postcard postmarked with missin' you
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
It's got the biggest sky you've ever seen, the coldest beer you'd ever drink
But I still feel like I landed on the moon
'Cause it ain't got you
Houston, we got a problem
We got a problem
Houston, we got a problem

TITLE: Blue Collar Boys
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
We were just river kids
Pickin' up stones like David did
Watchin' them long necks break off of Freight Train Bridge
We went to church in a Detroit car
Our daddies drank draft at the local bar
With an achin' back just like old Granddad did
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys
We're the white paint peeling off a picket fence
The rust stains covering a Craftsman wrench
When the sun's coming up you can bet we're clocking in
Cash our paycheck, two day break, and do it again
We like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys
We're worn out boots and old Levi's
The wind behind the stars and stripes
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys
Blue collar boys

TITLE: This One's For You
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two 
And three or four I owe more than a few 
For all the times I couldn't find the answers 
Stumbling through the dark without a clue
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe more than a few
For all the times I couldn't find the answers
Stumbling through the dark without a clue
This one's for you
Mom and daddy always did their best
For a crazy fool who couldn't help himself
I thank God they were there to see me through
This one's for you
I told you all I'd write you a song
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
But this one's for you
I've been knocked down time and time again
Got picked back up by love and few good friends
Who reminded me of all I stood to lose
This one's for you
Yeah I told you all I'd write you a song
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
These might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
This one's for you
Made more than my fair share of the same mistakes
Bridges burned and lessons learned
A few things that I can't change
Some apologies are way past overdue
So this one's for you
Oh, I told you all I'd write you a song
Pour my heart in the melody
To keep you singing along
This might not be the right time
And these might not be the right lines to prove
For saying what I'm trying to
This one's for you
There's a couple people that I owe a beer or two
And three or four I owe than a few

TITLE: The Great Divide
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
We're striking matches on the TV
Setting fires on our phones
Bearing crosses we believe in dying on
Tempers flare, the flame flies higher
As we soar closer towards the sun
But I like to think too much damage ain't been done
We're all so far, so far apart now
It's as deep as it is wide
We're about to fall apart now
If we can't reach the other side
We gotta find a way across the great divide
Sometimes it seems that our convictions
Sidе of the fence that wе stand on
Makes us all too damn different to get along
But I've seen strangers love each other
Like a mother does her son
What we see ain't only all that's going on
We're all so far, so far apart now
It's as deep as it is wide
We're about to fall apart now
If we can't reach the other side
We gotta find a way across the great divide
We're all so far, so far apart now
It's as deep as it is wide
We're about to fall apart now
If we can't reach the other side
We gotta find a way across the great divide
The great divide

TITLE: I Know She Ain't Ready
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
You were wearing that black dress, coat, and cowboy boots
He was there but I didn't care, too busy staring at you
In the pouring rain with the blue
Lights flashing in the hills of Appalachian
Close to tears with makeup smeared, I asked her what had happened
But I know she ain't ready, she won't be for a while
And he broke her down and when I'm around, I can see it in her smile
She's fighting getting closer, it's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready, but that's alright with me
You wearing that red dress, pearls, and those high heels
Like the way it made you look, you love the way it made you feel
So I said to you, I'd sure love to do this again
And you said, me too, but I'm just not over him
And I know she ain't ready, she won't be for a while
And he broke her down and when I'm around, I can see it in her smile
She's fighting getting closer, it's just too plain to see
And I know she ain't ready, but that's alright with me
She started calling me baby
And two years laterM I was down on one knee
With a ring in hand, I said, "I'm your man and girl, will you marry me?"
She said, "You know that I'm ready, and I have been for a while
When the bells sound and you turn around
I'll be walking down the aisle"
This will only bring us closer, it's just too plain to see
And I know that we're ready, so that's alright with me
That's alright with me

TITLE: Even Though I'm Leaving
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared, I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Well, daddy grabbed my hand and said
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere

ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
I've been working this job 9 to 5
Minium wage and overtime
But here comes a few days of unpaid vacation
And there ain't no way jose i'll waste them
'Cause there ain't no better feeling then when
I pick up a beer can
And get to feeling like superman
Its Friday night yah
Hears the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple an'
Keep it 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can't stand
No, nothing picks me up like a beer can
Well I woke up at 1 pm
And introduced myself to my new girlfriend
And there's a racking ball size hole in the wall in the basement
I ain't got no clue how or who could've made it
Well all I knew how is shit hit the fan
And here we go again
So I pick up a beer can
And get to feeling like superman
It's Saturday out
Heres the plan
I'm gonna throw back a couple an'
Keep it 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Until the point where I can't stand
No, nothing picks me up like a beer can
Well it's Sunday now
And I'm freaking out 'cause I can't handle 5 days without
Yeah I'm picking up a beer can
And get to feeling like superman
Its Sunday, who gives a damn
I'm gonna throw back a couple an'
Keep it 'em glued to my right hand
Any flavor, size, or brand
Till the point where I can't stand
No, nothing picks me up like a beer can
Like a beer can
No, nothing picks me up like a beer can

TITLE: The Way She Rides
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Screamed into the driveway, with my foot stuck on the gas 
Had the Crown mixed up in a Dixie cup, when she hopped into the cab 
She said, "Boy what you got in store, what we getting into tonight?" 
Hell, I don't care, It ain't here nor there, just as long as you're by my side
Screamed into the driveway, with my foot stuck on the gas
Had the Crown mixed up in a Dixie cup, when she hopped into the cab
She said, "Boy what you got in store, what we getting into tonight?"
Hell, I don't care, It ain't here nor there, just as long as you're by my side
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides
So we hit that ground a running, throwing caution to the wind
And it wasn't long before that drink was gone, and she was shakin' that ass again
She said find somewhere dark where we can park, and put a hurtin' on this bottle
So we said goodnight to the city lights, kicking it in full throttle
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides
Whether she's sitting shotgun with her hair done
Or with the seats leaned back and the radio on
On the backstreets, in the backseat
Those baby blue eyes staring back at me
Whether it's in park or it's in drive
I love the way she rides
The way she rides
The way she rides, yeah, yeah
The way she rides

TITLE: Cold As You
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
It's junked out joint off a backroad
A blinkin' window sign with an arrow
A gravel Iot chocked full of toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to
They got "Whiskey River" on a jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, broke clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
A bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture of you on a dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me
"Whiskey River" on a jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, broke clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
Of this broke heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
When guys like me lose girls like you
That's where we run to
We got "Whiskey River" on a jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, broke clock

TITLE: Used To You

LYRICS:
That old phone of mine,
2: 39, AM
When I got the call
Half asleep
Thought it was a dream,
But it wasn't afterall
That old dog of yours
Sitting on the porch
Waits for you to come home
Little does he know
That you won't
Be walking through that door
I just leave him alone
'Cause lettin' go don't come that easily
Most of the time, I can get by
It's just a little hard on me
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours,
Sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there
At church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin'
Without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone
That old rocking chair
Sitting over there
It don't rock no more
And that old six string
Ain't played a thing
Been a while since it's hummed a chord
I just leave 'em alone cause lettin' go
Don't come that easily
Most of the time
I can get by, it's just a little hard on me
But I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours,
Sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there
At church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin'
Without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to you bein' gone
There's a lot of things in this whole world I can stand
But when it comes to losin' you
I just can't...
Yeah, but I'm gettin' used to that old truck of yours,
Sittin' out in the drive
I'm gettin' used to you not bein' there
At church on Sunday night
I'm gettin' used to the radio playin'
Without you singin' along
But I'll never get used to
No, I'll never used to you bein' gone

I always thought the whiskey was just somethin' that you sipped
I always thought a smoke was somethin' I'd never do again
I thought I was in control
And I was on a roll
I never thought a picture was enough break me down
I never knew a king size bed was just another place to drown
Or how lonely lonely sounds
But man, I get it now
I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
I thought I knew it all, but girl, I guess you're showin' me
I'm findin' out how freedom can feel anything but free
And how hurtin' hurts like hell
Yeah, as far as I can tell
I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
Soon as it's gone I find out
Your memory is still around
And here to stay
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers

PFG's coming cross the creek
Z71, headlights shinin' through the trees
The boys spill out of the back seat
And ask me, what's it gonna be tonight
I said I'm just trying to get loose
Trying to make a move
Don't matter what we do
As long as we're out there
Somewhere where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And god only knows where we'll go
And hell I don't care
As long as we're out there
We pulled in, threw it in park
And follow the orange glow in the dark
And the trail marks
Through the fire and flames we locked eyes
She walked over from the other side
And smiled when I said
I'm just trying to get loose, trying to set the mood
Don't matter what we do
As long as we're out there
Somewhere where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And god only knows where we'll go
And baby I don't care
As long as we're out there
As long as we're out there
As long as we're out there
Somewhere where we can go
Get away from it all, get lost
And god only knows where we'll go
And hell I don't care
As long as we're out there
As long as we're out there

TITLE: Doin' This
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Someone asked me once in an interview
"What was growing up like, where'd you go to school?
And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar and an old barstool
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CDs just to give away
Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I wasn't doin' this
It ain't about the fame
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about
Having a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town

LYRICS:
I've been doing my best to make church on Sundays
And ain't been calling in hungover most Mondays
I guess you could say I'm being grown up
I got my shit together and oddly enough
I don't mind
'Cause it's about time
But if you second guessin', don't think for a second
That I can't hang
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
You can bet these boots have got a little used to
Stomping on a hardwood floor
And buying the bar another round of shots
Close my tab and hit the parking lot
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time
Well most folks think I don't know how to throw down
They done forgot about Rowdy
But no doubt he's still around
So keep cracking those jokes
'Cause I'm willing and able
Yeah, this old boy'll drink you under the table
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
You can bet these boots have got a little used to
Stomping on a hardwood floor
And buying the bar another round of shots
Close my tab and hit the parking lot
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time
At 3AM I'm still hanging tough
My buddy's passed out in the bed of my truck
And I can't wait 'til he wakes up
And see the pictures on his phone
'Cause I've been known to get a little bit of wild and reckless
Known to have a little bit of beer with breakfast
You can bet these boots have got a little used to
Stomping on a hardwood floor
And buying the bar another round of shots
Close my tab and hit the parking lot
Next stop is a spot with a fridge stocked on the back porch
I ain't afraid to take too many steps out of line
So don't tempt me with a good time

LYRICS:
I'm on this red-eye rolling down a runway
Window seat, nonstop one-way
2 PM, Gate B10, it can't come soon enough
I've got a mid-flight magazine and a mixed drink
I wish time would fly right with me
Damn the days that baggage claim's in another taxi town
But they always bring me back to you
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you
I've spent every mile missing you, baby
It's enough to drive me crazy
"I love you"'s from hotel rooms
They sure do make it tough
But they always bring me back to you
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you
In all these nothing towns
You in this whole world around
You're the only place I wanna get back to
'Cause I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like
And still ain't seen nothing like
And still ain't seen nothing like
Nothing like you
Nothing like you

TITLE: Can I Get An Outlaw
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Back in the day it was a six gun and a six string 
Man, that was country 
An that's the way country still out to be 
It was lived, not taught, it was earned not bought
Back in the day it was a six gun and a six string
Man, that was country
An that's the way country still out to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you what I thinks really gone wrong
But these days, it's all wannabes singing someone else's songs
And everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing baccer and whipping ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time
"Haus, you sure Hank done it this way?"
We don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard or Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing baccer and whipping ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
Are the good times really gone for good?
Or can we get back to our roots?
And it's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do
'Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing baccer and whipping ass
I need a preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
And now I pray country answers my call
Can I get an outlaw?
Oh, can I get an outlaw?

TITLE: Beer Never Broke My Heart
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
I've had a largemouth, bass bust my line
A couple of beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much man
That ain't ever let me down
Longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams
Have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me
The bars and this guitar
And longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red tail lights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now
Longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams
Have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me
The bars and this guitar
And longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
It's gripping down on a cold one
'Cause longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams
Have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream it just dawned on me
The bars and this guitar
And longneck, ice cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

TITLE: Angels Workin' Overtime
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
I'm a 50-hour paycheck
Ain't slept a damn wink
Moth to a neon light
I'm a nine to five, ten to two
Shower in between the two
Let it ride kinda guy
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
My Mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
"Son, how the hell you get by?"
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
I got some barstool best friends
Little off the deep end
That's my kinda crowd
A little rough around the edges
Get a little reckless
Might get a little too loud
But we'll be fine
With our angels workin' overtime
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
My Mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
"Son, how the hell you get by?"
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Come on
Ooh, Gary sounds good on that steel
Come on, come on, Ben
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
My Mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
"Son, how the hell you get by?"
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Oh, I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Time to clock in, boys
Come on
Angels workin' overtime

TITLE: Be Careful What You Wish For
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Couldn't wait to ride out of that one horse town
Didn't see no use in sticking around
I was green and busting at the seams to leave
I was sitting on G, waiting on O
The day I hit eighteen, I hit the road
Traded that county maintain for a four lane city street
But sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
What you want ain't always what you need
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone and you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for
She was holding on just a little too tight
Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives
I broke her heart thinking freedom would set me free
Well sometimes things ain't what you think they're gonna be
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone and you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
So be careful what you wish for
'Cause these city lights can't shine quite like the stars
I wish I could wish her back into my arms
Don't know what you got 'til it's gone And you're out on your own
All you want is what you can't get back
Once you let it go, then you know what you have
Don't hold a candle to what you had
Sometimes what you think you'll find
It ain't quite what real life has in store
And you can't get her back no more
So be careful what you wish for
Be careful what you wish for

TITLE: A Long Way
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Six beers, five guys
And if I remember right
It was a Wednesday when we got our buzz off
A second-hand six pack
Half smoked, soft pack
Light it up, boys take a drag
And when I fought that cough off everyone else thought
I was so damn cool
My head was spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah, man it really rocked my world
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little bit longer
I can't tell you why they did
But things seemed to never end back then
Oh, way back when
When a little went a long way
One girl, and 45 bucks was all it took that night
Hit the steak house, make-out in the movies
Way up in the back
Credits roll, on pace
To make it all the way to second base
Tried to play it cool like it was nothing new
And she didn't have clue
And my head was spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl
Yeah, man she really rocked my world
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little bit longer
I can't tell you why they did
But things seemed to never end back then
Oh, way back when
When a little went a long way
Back when everything seemed just a little bit stronger
Back when the weekend lasted a little bit longer
I can't tell you why they did
But things seemed to never end back then
Oh, way back when
When a little went a long way
A long, long way
A long way

TITLE: Forever After All
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
A cold beer's got 12 ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a 45
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But heaven knows that that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all
After all

You might find us early sunrisin'
Tractor drivin', growin' your greens
Stayin' alive, workin' 9 to 5
Just livin' that American dream
We're the plumbers and the preachers
The pre-care teachers
The mailman in your neighbourhood
But it don't matter what we do
We damn sure do it good
My kinda folk buy beer on Friday
Get right on Saturday night
We're all good people
Spend Sunday under steeple
Come Monday we'll be right on time
There oughta be a law against workin' this hard
And still havin' this much fun
We get it done, drink a beer
Catch a fish, hunt a deer
And then we'll firе up a little smoke
Me and my kinda folk
Thеre's a whip of southern wind singin'
And a red sun sinkin'
Back beneath a grove of oak trees
We're takin' it slow, easy come easy go
A county road philosophy
I ain't sayin' it's right, what we're livin' like
But it feels pretty hard to beat
Yeah, my kinda folk buy beer on Friday
Get right on Saturday night
We're all good people
Spend Sunday under steeple
Come Monday we'll be right on time
There oughta be a law against workin' this hard

TITLE: When It Rains It Pours
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
Sunday morning, man
She woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinkin' that her leavin'
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishin' down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Ex-future-mother-in-law anymore
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours

You're from one side of the tracks

Why we don't see eye-to-eye
Really ain't no wonder
But you got the rock and I got the roll
You got the heart and I got the soul
So let's just be friends
Ain't gotta fight about it
Let's find a way around it
Let's just be friends
Hey, what do you say?
If we don't even know what we were fussin' about
Don't you think it's time we work it out?
Let's just be friends
Hey, let's just be friends
Yeah, we're pretty good alone, but I bet that together
We could make some noise this town would talk about forever
We've been back and fourth and pickin' sides
When you ain't wrong and I ain't right
So let's just be friends
Ain't gotta fight about it
Let's find a way around it
Let's just be friends
Hey, what do you say?
If we don't even know what we were fussin' about
Don't you think it's time we work it out?

TITLE: Better Together
ARTIST: Luke Combs
LYRICS:
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, "I love you, too" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

Honey, how's that drink goin' down
Seems a little still for 2 P.M
Holler if you need anything
I've got an ear to lend
I'll be right here cuttin' lines
Countin' cash and stockin' beers
I've got an idea what's on your mind
So in the meantime, think on this
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
This ain't my first rodeo
I've seen the other side of this bar
Pourin' salts on an open wound
Sittin' right there where you are
And I know it probably stings right now
Somehow more than that Jim Bean
But that clock on the wall will cure it all
Even though that ain't how it seems
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Girl, you ain't in this thing alone
Oh no, oh no
I've seen girls like you in here before
Watched broken hearts break
Through that door a time or two
And I'll bet he packed all his things
You set out to curse his name and have a few
And I'll bet you're doin' your best to move on
Well, you're not the only lonely one
No, you're not the only lonely one

This futon I crashed on in college, well it ain't all bad
But at least it don't smell like you
Patron up on the counter, well it ain't your red
And them long stems are long gone too
Put that record on, took your pictures off the shelf
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night into your goodbye, gone kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps
And this fiver, might only spin my tires to the other side of town
But at least I'm out of this house
And this dive's tired of playin' man it ain't my sound
But at least they're playin' it loud
Two beers in and I'll be long gone come 12
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night into your goodbye, gone kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps
Every sip, every drink
That girl, that wink
Ain't much but I think
That every little bit helps
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night into your goodbye, gone kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps
Oh, yeah, every little bit helps

Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks' n' Dunn, Bayside
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par five
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room

Doin' everything I know to do
To keep the truth
From runnin' through my mind

Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into goin' out
With hopes you were stayin' in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was dropping
Thunder 'n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
And if I woulda just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was driving
Thunder 'n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me Category 5
With your smile, blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hiding
Stars quit shining
Rain was dropping
Thunder 'n lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Hit me like a hurricane

Tryin' to buy some beer for some Georgia girls
And I got wore out by my daddy
For stealin' cigarettes from the Smokes and more
And all my friends would get away
Seems I'd get caught, plain as day
I took the blame for every little thing
But I got away with you
And somehow l still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre
And the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels
And l got away with you
Well lookin' like you do
On its damn own, should be a crime
Let alone a fool like me
Hand in hand with you, should be doin' time
But here we are runnin' free
Guess someone turned the other cheek
'Cause there ain't no blue lights in the rear view
Guess I got away with you
And somehow l still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre
Now the Mona Lisa's hanging in my house
I bust out of Buckingham with the crown jewels
And l got away with you
I'll take it all, the fails, the falls
The county jails and one phone calls
I'd do it all again if I had to
'Cause I got away with you
Somehow girl, I still ain't been found out
It's a crazy truth
Like l strolled out the gates of Alcatraz
And l walked in the Louvre

I put that record on
Girl you know what song
And I let it play again and again
You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah tonight I'm wondering
What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
Or is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to?
I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad
I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah it's about to drive me mad
What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
And is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new
What are you listening to
Is it a feel good song gets you driving too fast
The one that gets you moving on pass to pass
Or the kind you can't help singing along
Singing whoa
Is it headphones on on a downtown train
Or a window seat on an outbound plane
Is it LA sunny and Memphis blue
I wish I knew I wish I knew
What are you listening to
Is it a cover band in some college town bar
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars
And is it something to get you through
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fall and hearts still breakin'
Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new

But I walked with the angels that day
She takes me by the hand
I am the luckiest man alive
Did I tell you, baby

Some may have their riches
Some may have their worldly things
As long as I have you

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man I've seen so much traffic
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love
So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love

When I think of you and the first time we met
And I heard the sound of your sweet gentle voice
My heart took me over and gave me no choice
And right then I knew
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
When I look at you now the years have gone by
I think of the memories that time can't erase
And all of the smiles that you've brought to my face
Your love's been so true
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
When I leave this earth you'll be holding my hand
And it gives me comfort to know you'll be there
And I'll thank the Lord for the love that we've shared
You're heaven to me
It makes me want more of you
Again and again
I fall more in love with you
Than I've ever been
From the moment you wake me up
'Till you kiss me goodnight
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you
Everything that you do
It makes me want more of you

TITLE: Tryin' To Untangle My Mind
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Well I drank a lot of whiskey in my time
And I've held a lot of women that were fine
And I made a little money, I blew every dime
Tryin' to untangle my mind
Well I've made a lot of choices that were wrong
That the good lord spend too many nights alone
And I've been out on the edge, and I've stumbled 'cross the line
Tryin' to untangle my mind
So if you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil loved me high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind
Well, I do what I do and I don't know why
But I do what I do, 'til the day I die
No heartache for the ticket
So I guess I'll pay the fine
Tryin' to untangle my mind
If you see me, and I'm lonesome and stoned
So far down, the devil loved me high
I'm just trying to untangle my mind
Yes I'm tryin' to untangle my mind

TITLE: Last Thing I Needed, First Thing This Morning
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Postman delivered
A past due bill notice
The alarm clock rang two hours late
The garbage man left all the trash
On the sidewalk
And the hinges fell off of the gate
And this morning at breakfast
I spilled all the coffee
And I opened the door on my knee
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Last night you came home late
I knew you'd been drinking
By that old mellow look on your face
I thought, "It don't matter
'Cause it's the holiday season"
And you fill such a big empty space
And I laid down beside you
And I wanted your lovin'
'Cause your love makes my life complete
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
So excuse me for lookin'
Like my world just ended
And excuse me for lookin'
Like I just lost my best friend
And excuse me for lovin'
Being forgiving
Just go on if you wanna be free
The last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me
Oh, the last thing I needed
The first thing this morning
Was to have you walk out on me

TITLE: I Was Wrong
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
I've been thinking 'bout my thoughtless words
And I know just how much they must have hurt
And I take it back
Won't you let me take it back?
You know I told you that I don't love you
That I'd be better off with someone new
But I take it back
Won't you let me take it back?
Girl you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby I was wrong?
What I wouldn't give to be your lover again
All I want to do is touch your skin, yeah
If I had you right here right now
I'd tell you, tell you, tell you, tell you
Girl you know that I still love you
And you know that I'm so alone
I don't know why
I told you that I didn't need you
Can't you see that baby I was wrong?

TITLE: Arkansas
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Took a Nine Eleven 'bout a hundred and seven down a back road
Where the white river runs and the southern sun makes the kudzu grow
And what I found in the Ozark mountains I ain't ever seen
It sure does feel like you're sittin' on top of the world to me
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Well, we burned through the one light towns like a scalded dog
When we lit out of Fayetteville, they were callin' the hogs
We made a pit stop in Little Rock for some barbecue
And when we hit West Memphis there were blue lights in our rear view
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
All the boys and the girls down there sure know how to have a ball
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas

TITLE: Tennessee Whiskey
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Used to spend my nights out in a barroom
Liquor was the only love I've known
But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
And brought me back from being too far gone
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
I've looked for love in all the same old places
Found the bottom of a bottle's always dry
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry wine
You're as warm as a glass of brandy
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time
You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey

Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
Hold up my right hand
Swear to the Promised Land
Rather die before I treat you bad
All I ask of you
Is treat me the same way, too
'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Want to leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know
First, you stole my heart
That was the easy part
Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay
Now that it's in your hands
Want you to understand
I would have given it to you anyway
Don't put my love on your back burner
Never let anything that hot get cold
And if you ever change your mind
Wanna leave my love behind
Just let me be the second one to know
Yeah, the second one to know

TITLE: Nobody To Blame
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
She took down the photograph
Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
Nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

TITLE: When I'm With You
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
I'm forty years old
And it looks like the end of the rainbow
Ain't no pot of gold
The things that I've done
I doubt anyone will remember
After I'm gone
The places I've been
There's some I'd go back to
And some where I won't go again
And most of the time
I'm feelin' like I'm fadin' into the night
But when I'm with you
I feel like a dreamer
That's had all his dreams come true
Like my skies are all blue
When I'm with you
Got a good job
And I'm thankful to be workin'
When so many good people are not
Sometimes I can't stand
How my back and my hands
They won't work like they used to
Somewhere in my mind
I'm still searchin' for something
I know that I'm not gonna find
When I know for sure
I've got so much more
Than a man ever needs
But when I'm with you
I feel like a dreamer
That's had all his dreams come true
Like my skies are all blue
When I'm with you
I'm forty years old
And it looks like the end of the rainbow
Ain't no pot of gold

Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat 
To a better place than the one we're at 
And I ain't got no kinda plan 
But I've had all of this town I can stand
Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one we're at
And I ain't got no kinda plan
But I've had all of this town I can stand
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been saving for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
When nobody wins afraid of losing
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosing
Some day we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And, honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny
You can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
Starting over
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be

TITLE: Without Your Love
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Yesterday just came and went
And today dealt me another hand of heartache that I'll play
What we said and what we meant
Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams
And tomorrow I'll wake up and have to feel you fade away
And that's the way it goes it seems
Tears filled with pain and they fall like rain
Constant reminders every day
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
And every moment's a crime
The more I live without you
Just can't get around you
Nobody else can set me free
Baby, please come back to me
Baby, please come back to me
Without your love
The sky is grey
Without your love
I'm just waiting on the sun shine
Without your love
Every hour is the darkest time of day
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And every moment's a crime
Without your love
And I'm just doing my time
Without your love
And every moment's a crime

TITLE: Millionaire
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
They say "Love is more precious than gold"
Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure so very rare
She's made me a millionaire
When we ride around, ride around this old town
In my beat-up car, with the windows down
People look at her and they look at me
And say "That boy is sure living in luxury"
Sweet luxury
Because love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Life reaches on, millionaire
When my pocket's are empty and my cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire
'Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought, no, and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

Oh!
Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said "Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own"
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, then for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine
That's the longest day in a prisoner's mind
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Midnight train to Memphis
Oh, Midnight train to Memphis

There's a bottle
On the dresser by your ring
And it's empty
So right now I don't feel a thing
I'll be hurting
When I wake up on the floor
But I'll be over it by noon
That's the difference
Between whiskey and you
Come tomorrow
I can walk in a store
It ain't a problem
They'll always sell me more
It's your forgiveness
Well, that's something I can't buy
There ain't a thing that I can do
That's the difference
Between whiskey and you
One's the devil
One keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder
If they ain't both the same
One's a liar
That helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth
That's the difference between whiskey and you
I've got a problem
But it ain't like what you think
I drink because I'm lonesome
And I'm lonesome 'cause I drink
But if I don't break down
And bring it on myself
It'll hit out of the blue
That's the difference
Between whiskey and you
One's the devil
One keeps driving me insane
At times, I wonder
Ohhw if they ain't both the same
But one's a liar
That helps to hide me from my pain
And one's the long gone bitter truth

Between an angel and a ghost
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy 'em

Wish I could come home from workin'
And not have ya checkin' my breath
I'm tired of her turning her questions
Into the Gettysburg Address
There's no reason why she shouldn't trust me
The fact that she don't makes me mad
Can't count all the times that I begged her
Honey, just let my past be the past
I used to drink like a fish and run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People call me the Picasso of paintin' the town
But I've finally grown up
And I finally changed from that someone I was to somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
Gave up on bringing her flowers
And that just kept making things worse
I ain't been guilty of nothin'
Of being the man she deserves
I used to drink like a fish, run like a dog
Done a whole lotta shit not permitted by law
People call me the Picasso of paintin' the town
But I've finally grown up
I finally changed from that someone I was to somebody I ain't
But she finds it hard to believe that she's turned me around
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down
I used to cuse like a sailor and howl at the moon
And I woke up some mornings with I don't know who
But I never dreamed back then that I'd have to pay for it now
You know I'll probably die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' now
Yeah, I'd hate to die before I live all my
Up to no good livin' down

TITLE: Maggie's Song
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Let me tell you a story
About an old friend of mine
Somebody left her in a shopping cart
In a parking lot for us to find
Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
We put her in the back seat
Told her we were taking her home
Run, Maggie, run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie, run
Be just as free as you are wild
A few kids later
We moved out on the farm
And she followed those kids around
Yeah, she kept them safe from harm
And she loved to chase squirrels
And playing out in the snow
She'd take off like a bullet
Man, you should have seen her go
Run, Maggie, run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie, run
Be just as free as you are wild
It was raining on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by her side
She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye
Run, Maggie, run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie, run
Be just as free as you are wild
I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
I can tell you right now
That a dog has a soul
And I thought to myself
As we buried her on the hill
I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will
Run, Maggie, run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie, run
Be just as free as you are wild
Oh, run, Maggie, run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie, run
Be just as free as you are wild

TITLE: Daddy Doesn't Pray Anymore
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
I remember even when the times were bad
He thanked Jesus for everything he had
For a good wife and three children
And the food upon our plates
Yeah, everything was right when he said, grace
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I laid down at night
I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finished talking to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore
Today I followed daddy down to church
And listened to the preacher read God's word
We sang his favorite hymn but daddy didn't make a sound
This afternoon we'll lay him in the ground
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I guess he's finally walking with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
But daddy doesn't pray anymore

TITLE: Was It 26
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Livin' hard was easy when I was young and bullet-proof
I had no chains to bind me, just a guitar and a roof
Emptied every bottle, when I poured I never missed
I had blood shot eyes at twenty five or was it twenty six
Didn't seem to matter what price I had to pay
'Cause anything worth havin', I'd just lose anyway
Friends worried about me they'd asked if I was sick
Thought I wouldn't die at twenty five or was it twenty six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around
But if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty five
Or was it twenty six
Met a girl from Georgia, smart and pretty, college grad
I thought my luck was changin' but then it all went bad
I guess I fell in love with her all it took was just one kiss
But then she said goodbye at twenty-five or was it twenty six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around
But if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty five
Or was it twenty six
I've been down that road before almost as far as hell
Deception or redemption, I guess only time will tell
I have faith and the knowledge that God gave us a gift
I couldn't hide at twenty-five or was it twenty-six
Those two years run together like whiskey over ice
Melted into memories like somebody else's life
I'm glad to say, I've come around
But if I could have one wish
I'd like another try at twenty five
Or was it twenty six

You've got your troubles and I bet they're just like mine
Somebody told you goodbye
But I know a way that can't go wrong
Nobody leads nobody on
And nobody's lonely tonight
What's love but just some illusion we believe
What's love but just some confusion we don't need

What's love but just some confusion we don't need
You be her
And I'll be him
For a while we'll pretend
Nobody's lonely tonight

I'm past the point of give-a-damn
And all my tears are cried
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

TITLE: The Ballad Of The Lonesome Cowboy
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
I was a lonesome cowboy
Lonesome as I could be
You came along, changed my life
And fixed what was broken in me
I was a lonesome cowboy
I didn't have a friend
Now I got friends comin' out of my ears
I'll never be lonesome again
You can't be happy when you're all by yourself
Go on, tell me I'm wrong (you're wrong)
When someone takes you down from the shelf
And plays with you some, it's wonderful (wonderful)
I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore
I just found out what love is about
I've never felt this way before
I was a lonesome cowboy
But not anymore

TITLE: Broken Halos
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Angels come down from the heavens
Just to help us on our way
Come to teach us, then they leave us
And they find some other soul to save
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Don't go looking for the reasons
Don't go asking Jesus why
We're not meant to know the answers
They belong to the by and by
They belong to the by and by
Seen my share of broken halos
Folded wings that used to fly
They've all gone wherever they go
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine
Broken halos that used to shine

TITLE: Nashville, TN
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
I met you when I had a dream
Not so long ago, it seems
We closed down a million bars
Yeah, you and me, we've come so far
You showed me how to write a song
We wrote some right, we wrote some wrong
I was down and out, you let me in
At times, you were my only friend
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time I wish you well
You built me up, you set me free
And you tore down my memories
So you be you, and I'll be me
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
Now you won't miss me when I'm gone
You're custom made for movin' on
And time to time I'll pass you by
Face that I don't recognize
And who knows, maybe years from now
You'll be the one I think about
But I just can't imagine that
'Cause I'm not one for lookin' back
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
And you tore down my memories
So you be you and I'll be me
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
So long, Nashville, Tennessee
You can't have what's left of me
And as far as I can tell
It's high time I wish you well
You build me up, you set me free
And you tore down my memories
You're not who you used to be
So long, Nashville, Tennessee

TITLE: A Simple Song
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Lately things are on my mind
Good news is hard to find
And I work on the factory line
And all I do is stay behind
Call my mama like I should
She says daddy ain't doing too good
Me and him should wet a line
I just can't seem to find the time
But I love my life man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song
I finally saved some money up
'Til I had to fix my truck
Talked to brother the other day
He didn't have too much to say
Tryin' to quit these cigarettes
I can't seem to kick them yet
Sister got laid off last fall
And I got high cholesterol
But I love my life man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song
Yeah, I love my life man it's something to see
It's the kids and the dogs and you and me
It's the way it's alright when everything goes wrong
It's the sound of a slow simple song

TITLE: When The Stars Come Out
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
I was looking for a change of scene
You were looking at a magazine
It was red carpets and limousines and the grass seemed so much greener
All we wanted was to get there fast
So, we packed up everything we had
Runnin' on hope and a tank of gas
Like dreams ain't just for dreamers
We couldn't wait to leave that life behind
Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign
And one of those early nights
When the stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Everybody's, somebody, someday
Everybody's got a part to play
Everybody's tryin' to find a way
To say, what needs saying
Everybody's got a friend of a friend
Somebody that can get you in
Begging angels for a sin
In a game that we're all playin'
You and I, we're gamblers
Solding cards that we can't see
And I'm betting on you and
You're betting on me
One of those early nights
When the stars came out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
Down on the freeway
The sun is out of sight
And I got a feelin'
Tonight might be the night
Yeah, tonight might be the night
One of those early nights
The stars come out
Oh, the stars come out
And shine
And they burn so bright
They drown the downtown lights
When the stars come out
Oh, when the stars come out
When the stars come out
Ohwhoow
When the stars come out

Oh, gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone
I'm plannin' on feelin' much better before too long
I got a world of trouble I need to forget
I'm on my way, but I ain't there yet
So gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone

People ain't treatin' one another like they oughta
So gimme just one more puff of that worry be gone
Well, I don't wanna hear no preacher preachin'
No more politician bitchin'

Got me wonderin' where my baby's gone

TITLE: Scarecrow In The Garden
ARTIST: Chris Stapleton
LYRICS:
Well, he came from Northern Ireland
Searchin' for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been readin' Revelations
With my bare feet in the river
Well, the readhead son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
'Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been readin' Revelations
With my bare feet in the river
I know every single fence post
Every rock to go around
I've been starin' at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinkin' 'bout that river
Wonderin' how it turns to blood
I've been sittin' here all mornin'
I was sittin' here all night
There's a Bible in my left hand
And a pistol in my right

And kicked me out the door

And sleepin' on the floor

And put some music on
And since I'm all alone
I might as well get stoned
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had to be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone
I might as well get stoned
Now every time I watch the TV
Another soldier dies
Another brother's gone
Another mother cries
Now I know they've got a job to do
But if I had one wish
I wish they'd all come home
So, we could all get stoned
I might as well get stoned
Get it off my mind
Ain't got a thing to do
All I've got is time
The bottle's all I've had to be a friend of mine
And since my whiskey's gone

There's a tear in the mud on the banks of the river
And the sound of a lover's goodbye
And a pain in my heart 'cause I could not forgive her
That's as deep as the river is wide
I'm lost and I'm lonesome when I look in the mirror
I don't like the man that I see
And the more that I look, the more it gets clearer
Pride made a fool out of me
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
And I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise
The cold wind blows and the leaves start to scatter
And the rain will be comin' on soon
And everything's wrong and nothing don't matter
And a black cloud is crossin' the moon
So I drink all night
But the hurtin' won't stop
And every shot I take just turns into teardrops
And I lay down to sleep
And I pray I don't open my eyes
To a whiskey sunrise

Street lights along the highway
Throwing shadows in the dark
And the memories keep on turning
To the rhythm of a broken heart
You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute
There's a song that I remember
I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words
I never got to say
You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your parachute
Parachute
If you think you're going down
Just know I will be around
You only need a roof when it's raining
You only need a fire when it's cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey
Is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down
And falling feels like flying 'til you hit the ground
Say the word and I'll be there for you
Baby, I will be your

And I hope he'll forgive the things you ain't forgot
When I get drunk, and talk to God
When I talk to God I thank him for the time
All those precious years that you were mine all mine
And I know he's a busy man
He'll help me if he can
So when I talk to God, I thank him for the time
I wish that I could go to church but I'm too ashamed of me

Just like the rubber turnin' on the ground
Always lost and nowhere bound

Somebody else will have to sing this song
Somebody else will have to sing along, sing along

There ain't livin', there's just survival
Doesn't matter if you do or die

Fog lays heavy on the morning light

Yeah, they'll pay you to quit he'll tell you that it's hard, 'cause it is
But you can do anything, anything you want to
There's footprints on the moon (hey)
There's footprints on the moon (hey)

TITLE: Your Name On It
ARTIST: Gabby Barrett
LYRICS:
Someone tell me how long this will last 
Feeling let down, love is in the past 
Empty-handed, I feel empty-souled 
All the while, you live innocent
Someone tell me how long this will last
Feeling let down, love is in the past
Empty-handed, I feel empty-souled
All the while, you live innocent
You took it all
Shame on you for ever saying you love me
It's your fault for making me feel lucky
I believed in what you said, and what's worse, all the things I felt
Come on, let me bring you all the way down
I got a pencil in my pocket
I got a song with your name on it
For all my efforts, this is what I get
Livin' alone here, nothing but regret
This ain't about me, it's about right from wrong
And how I trusted you with everything I own
Are you listenin'?
Oh, shame on you for ever saying you love me
Yeah, it's your fault for making me feel lucky
I believed in what you said, and what's worse, all the things I felt
Come on now and let me bring you all the way down
Got a pencil in my pocket
I got a song with your name on it
Your name on it
You must be in a knot covering up what you done wrong
Two-timing, maybe three, now your future don't include me
Take yourself and get on down the road
Oh, shame on you for ever sayin' you love me
Yeah, it's your fault for making me feel lucky
I believe in what you said, and what's worse, all the things I felt
Come on now and let me bring you all the way down
Got a pencil in my pocket
Now, there's you got a song with your name on it
You must be in a knot covering up what you done wrong
(You got a song with your name)
Two-timing, maybe three, now your future don't include me
Take yourself and get on down the road

LYRICS:
Finally found the kind of man who stays
Like he promised
Like he said on that day
There's never been a sweeter love I've known
When I left him, he never left me alone
Nothing can separate me from amazing grace
Jesus You're all that I need
If everything falls apart
And I don't know where to start
You bring me back to my knees
'Cause You're good
And a God who's got me
Who's got me
When I was stuck inside my sin in shame
You pursued me
Though I spit in Your face
Nothing I could ever do to change
'Til You changed me ('til You came)
'Til You died in my place
Nothing can separate me from amazing grace
Jesus You're all that I need (hmm, hmm)
If everything falls apart
And I don't know where to start
You bring me back to my knees
'Cause You're good
And a God who's got me
Who's got me
Give me Jesus
Give me Jesus
You can have all this world
Give me Jesus (give me Jesus)
Give me Jesus (give me Jesus)
Give me Jesus (give me Jesus)
You can have all this world
You can have all this world

But give me Jesus
Nothing can separate me from amazing grace

If everything falls apart

You're the only reason I'm here

You stayed in the shadows of the spotlight
Gonna take the time, gonna let it shine on you tonight

Mm, mm
You live in that three bedroom, two bath your whole life
Think that you'll never grow up, then you're packin' up
Puttin' boxes into the back in your parents' driveway
You drive too slow and leave the only home you know
'Cause times like these, they go too fast
You blink like that
And you never get it back, never get it back
Hold today like it's your last
Once you let go
And you never get it back, never get it back
Soak it all in while you can
'Cause one of these seconds, you can't
So don't let it slip through your hands
I replay all of your voicemails to remind me
What you sound like and I still smile
I'd give anything to drive halfway across this country
To feel you hug me
To hear you say you love me
'Cause times like these, they go too fast
You blink like that
And you never get it back, never get it back
Hold today like it's your last
Once you let go
And you never get it back, never get it back
Hold 'em close, let 'em know
Don't hold nothing back
I don't know, you don't know
Just how long we have
Hold 'em close, let 'em know
Don't hold nothing back

TITLE: Fireflies

LYRICS:
Unrolled a blanket down by the water 
It’s just you & me tonight 
Our campfires gettin sleepy 
The whole world is going quiet
Unrolled a blanket down by the water
It’s just you & me tonight
Our campfires gettin sleepy
The whole world is going quiet
The evening light is fading away
A gentle breeze is blowing past
Making the grass slowly dance
Wish this night wouldn’t go so fast
Watching fireflies in West Texas
Sitting under the cypress trees
See the moon rise over the river
No place i’d rather be
Can’t stop life from racing by
There’s magic in the air tonight
I’ll remember every moment
For the rest of my life
I might see a shooting star but I wont wish on it anymore
Just you sayin that you love me
Is more than I could ask for
You & me and the fireflies
Lying under the cypress trees
See the sun rise over the river
No place i’d rather be
See the sun rise over the river
No place i’d rather be

LYRICS:
Not havin' that much money
Led to dreamin' that much more
And that got me to Nashville
Tryna knock down slammin' doors
One call led to a red eye, goodbye
What have I got to lose?
Then one thing led to another, led to another
It all led to you
Thank God for the hangups and the breakups
And the wake-up, make-up tears on my pillowcase
The all wrongs and the almosts
And the all time lows all took me to the way
My head fits on your shoulder
My heart can't help but stop
Mm, look at us, how could I not look at you
And thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
(Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God)
I remember feelin'
Love slippin' through my hands
He knew what He was doin'
I just didn't understand
One prayer led to an outta-nowhere boy
Too good to believe
One thing led to another, led to another
All led you to me
Thank God for the hangups and the breakups
And the wake-up, make-up tears on my pillowcase
The all wrongs and the almosts
And the all time lows all took me to the way
My head fits on your shoulder
My heart can't help but stop
Mm, look at us, how could I not look at you
And thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
(Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God)
All the hurt that I've gone through
I'd be crazy not to
Thank God for the hangups and the breakups
And the wake-up, make-up tears on my pillowcase
The all wrongs and the almosts
And the all time lows all took me to the way
My head fits on your shoulder
My heart can't help but stop
Mm, look at us, how could I not look at you

Without landing your lips on mine
Ain't just there when it's easy
You're there all the time
Livin' to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Beats everything I've ever felt
Yeah, I know that I got it good
And so would everybody else
If love had a hall of fame
For a summer kiss in the rain
For making me wanna stay
Wrapped in your arms all night, all day
For the way you look at me
It should all go down in history
They'd hang your picture on the wall
And write your name
If love had a hall of fame
If love had a hall of fame
You'd be up there on that stage
Shining brighter than the lights
And I'd be out there in the crowd
Telling everybody that you're mine
If love had a hall of fame
For a summer kiss in the rain
For making me wanna stay
Wrapped in your arms all night, all day

On some sunrise wheat
You can kiss me fast
And drive real slow
That old Chevy might take as long as it takes
You and Jesus will fix my soul

On the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I
I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Yeah babe, I hope she
Shows up in a 2AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I
I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Like you did on me

TITLE: I Hope (Duet)
ARTIST: Gabby Barrett
LYRICS:
I, I hope she makes you smile
The way it made me smile
On the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby I
I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turns into a blur, yeah
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
Yeah babe, I hope she
Shows up in a 2AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy, and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone waiting by the phone
And then she calls
And baby I
I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
I hope it goes, comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way
About her that I feel about you right now
I hope you both feel the sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

The first Noel the angels did say 
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay 
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep 
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
The first Noel the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the Earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Then let us all with one accord
Singing praises to our heavenly Lord
That hath made heaven and earth of nought
And with his blood mankind hath bought
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

TITLE: Too Drunk To Drive
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
There ain't a liquor store, dive bar, or corner booth for twenty miles around
We ain't on a boat, on a lake, in the sun with a cooler loaded down
But suddenly, I'm feeling all impaired from the way you looked at me from over there
Rolling like I'm stoned past gone, looking in your eyes
Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
You can hide my keys, lock the door, maybe we can find something here to do
Maybe wreck some sheets, crash your lips into mine and not even make the news
These four walls are safer than them two lanes
You pour 'em tall when you start whispering my name
Ain't no blue light, line walkin', happening tonight
Girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah girl, I'm too, I'm too, I'm too drunk to drive
What do I do with you? Let's lay it low tonight
Got me high, got me right, got me flyin' 'cause you're looking so fine
I ain't had no shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive
No, I ain't had a shot, ain't drank a drop
But I'm too drunk to drive (woo)
I'm just too drunk to drive
I'm too drunk to drive
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm too drunk to drive

TITLE: Songs You Never Heard
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I heard "Run" on the radio yesterday
Got me thinking 'bout, how much you loved George Strait
But by the time the airwaves ever played that song
You were already gone, you were already home
And there ain't no one that sounds like Whitley
But I bet you'd find something you'd sing with me
We weren't just
Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A Lot About Living, a little 'bout love
Time Marches On, there's a lot of new
Music and memories, we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard
Everything sounded better with the windows down
In your Silverado, rolling 'round that two-lane town
Now there's a few more ball caps, a few less cowboy hats
But we're still singing 'bout dirt roads
I think you'd be okay with that
And I'm thinking about the way you would've acted
The first time you ever heard "In Color"
Man, it makes me wanna go back
When we were just
Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A Lot About Living, a little 'bout love
Time Marches On, there's a lot of new
Music and memories, we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard
You'd be a little off key
Out on the road with me
High fiving my whole band
Mama claims it, but we all know
You'd be my number 1 fan... and we'd be
Killing time singing "Killin' Time"
It was the soundtrack of our lives
Chasing girls and growing up
A Lot About Living, a little 'bout love
Time Marches On, there's a lot of new
Music and memories, we'd be drinking to
I think about it and I laugh until it hurts
'Cause I can hear you singing along
To songs you never heard
To songs you never heard

TITLE: Roller Coaster
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
She had a cross around her neck
And a flower in her hair
That I picked from the side of thomas drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back
We spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I should've known where it was goin'
Still tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
And I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
When Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted, yeah, I'm still twisted
Like that old beach roller coaster
Like that old beach roller coaster

TITLE: In Love With The Girl
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
It feels like I woke up one mornin'
And it all changed without warnin'
I don't know how our paths crossed
But all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers
Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancin on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singin'
Or the way it all happened without even thinkin'
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl
I talk about bein' caught off guard
Talk about an old boy fallin' hard
Think about a few weeks flyin' by
And talk about losin' track of time
Now I'm countin' every second until I see her
Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancin on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singin'
Or the way it all happened without even thinkin'
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl
I was cool with hangin around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Sayin things I ain't never said
And bein with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I've been watching and talked down to you all night long
Girl it's so wrong
How we, don't even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he don't even see
You're too pretty to left alone
Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home
Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
'Cause you gonna do what you wanna do
Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
It's the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes
Are you leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him (Are you really leaving with him)
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
Come on girl, won't you go with me

Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel
I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start
Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself, oh boy you got it so damn good
Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down, and the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost in how good looking girl
You can be when you don't even mean to be because it's so natural
With your hair pulled up and my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
'Cause you start
Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself, oh you boy you got it so good with this good looking girl
Good morning good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothing quite like when you're
Rocking me, rocking me, gotta roll with it
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'm gon' lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself, oh you boy you got it so good with this good looking girl
You're my good looking girl

LYRICS:
Hungover in a hotel room
Cell phone's dead
You're stretched out next to me
Lost somewhere in a dark whiskey dream
Hungover in a hotel room
Call the concierge
Two bloody Mary's and some cigarettes
So you can wake up to breakfast in bed
Hear your voice in my head
Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out
Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci fallin' on the floor with the lights down low
Dancin' in the dark, body killin' me
Throwin' off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
Slide the curtains back
Light up the mornin' on the balcony
Look at you stirrin' in the shadows and sheets
Last night on repeat
Hey, when you gonna come pick me up?
You always say we're gonna burn it down
If you want it baby, call me back
Call me back, maybe we can hang out
Then it was room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci fallin' on the floor with the lights down low
Dancin' in the dark, body killin' me
Throwin' off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
There's that smile drivin' me wild
Call the front desk, late check out request
You know, better yet, book it for another night
Room 704, hang a sign on the door
Gucci fallin' on the floor with the lights down low
Dancin' in the dark, body killin' me
Throwin' off sparks
Lay it back baby, anything goes
Spent the whole night last night all messed up, making love
Girl, I swear I've never felt this good
Waking up hungover in a hotel room
Oh oh, oh, hungover in a hotel room

TITLE: Too Damn Young
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
We met down at the floatin dock
She snuck out scared she might get caught
We were nervous, mmm but it was worth it
There was no such thing as consequence
With her in my arms if finally made sense
In that moonlight, I saw her tanlines
Everytime our feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there, with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing, but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
The t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
The fog rolled in, she said I better go
She took my t-shirt and wore it home
A memory, a souvenir she could keep
So I stayed and watched that sunrise
Like it was waking up my life
To what love was, I could still see us
Everytime our feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there, with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing, but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
The t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
Everytime our feet are dangling in the water
I can't help but think about her
Lying there, with her wet hair
Didn't know what we were doing, but we didnt care
That old wooden dock was warm on our backs
The t-shirt for a pillow and just like that
She kissed me like she meant forever
We were too damn young to know any better
We were too damn young to know any better

Girl, you and me ain't talking much
I just slam the door and leave in my truck
There ain't nothing left for us?
I think enough's enough
I look down, see your name there on my phone
Then I hit ignore and just drive on
We've been living like this too long
And there ain't no reason to turn around
Baby, you can have it all
I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time was the last time, baby
I can only change who I am so much,
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
I've been there, done that
Street by street and town after little down
Feels like I'm on the right road now
I bet you're wondering how, I could just walk out
I put you high up as I could
And I know I've done everything I should,
To try and make a bad thing good
I guess it just took too long for me to see,
That we ain't meant to be
I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time was the last time, baby
I can only change who I am so much,
And all I can give is all my love
And my love ain't never been enough
So I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
I'll wake up and I'll start to second-guess myself
And I'll crave your touch oh but I know too well
But I ain't, I ain't coming back
I've already been there, done that
And I'm done with you messing with my mind
The last time was the last time, baby
I can only change who I am so much,

Roll up in the mornin'
And hand you a coffee
Tell ya hurry up

Don't give you no warning
When they shoot up a stop sign
Out on some old county road
I've got ones that I've fought with
And outrun the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime if I had it
Got one on the wagon
And one out there draggin'
A plow behind an old John Deere
They work hard for their money
Their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road ridin'
Buddies
Buddies
Smell trouble 'fore it happens
And when it starts to happen
They're right with you
Rollin' in a parking lot

Make your girlfriend so mad
Keep your momma from sleepin'
And they both know way too well
I've got ones that I've fought with
And outrun the law with
Ones that I'd give my last dime if I had it
Got one on the wagon
And one out there draggin'
A plow behind
An old John Deere
They work hard for their money
Their boots all stay muddy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road ridin'
Buddies
I got one in a Humvee
That keeps all of us free
One that got his heart broke
And went half crazy
Got one that moved far away
One that rings my phone everyday
And one when he hears this
He'll shed a tear
They work hard for their money
Give everything they got to mommy
All my beer drinkin', deer draggin'
Dusty dirt road riddin'
Tailgating, good-time
Trash talkin', tall walkin' buddies
All my buddies
Y'all know who you are
Catch y'all on the flipside

My shoulder still burns
My head still hurts
There's sand from your shoes in my floorboard
Lipstick on the straw, your crying eyes
I paint it in my rear view
My speakers still blast that song
That you turned me on to
It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home
Still hear your words saying we can't do this
'Cause you're up there and I'm down here
Baby let's go on and face it
It's like that blue water ran up the highway
It's so intense, it's blowing out my tail gate
And that sunset is still hanging on
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss
Yeah I was a fool to think I could just move on
'Cause you and the beach followed me home
I left the lights, the cars, the parties on the strip
The up all nights and your sunrise kiss

It don't feel like you're really gone

Couple hours til dark
Wishing one would walk by
Might as well left my gun in the gun rack
Been here all day all I killed a 12 pack
Sitting here
Waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties
Missing hitting pine trees
It ain't my fault them cans keep moving
My baby's on the phone
Saying baby come home
Where ya been and whatcha been doing
Well i've been sitting here
Waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
The only deer i seen
Been john deer green
But that don't mean
That i got a raw deal
Cause there ain't no boss
Callin' me hoss
Ticking me off
On the edge of this corn field
On my second box of winchester hundred grains
Ain't seen a big buck
But its been a good day
Sitting here
Waiting on a deer
Drinkin' beer and wastin' bullets
Aiming at the empties

How it can make you feel so alive
Tell ya what we can do,

Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?
We can take the tractor down the road, go walkin' 'round the bend
Lay by the river, climb up in the barn
Welcome to the farm, yeah yeah
There ain't no card in your pocket
If we're gonna turn that old gas pump on
It's cash for everything around here
That's just the way it's been for so long
How'd you like a coke in a green glass bottle?
It's colder than that plastic stuff
Watch how miss Annie at the counter
Tells that story 'bout me wreckin' my truck
Welcome to the farm
Where you can roll your windows down
Baby take my arm,
Ain't hearin' nothin' such a beautiful sound?

How 'bout that blue sky
So pretty it'll make you cry (Welcome to the farm)
We can roll on over yonder

Watch the wind whirl by

Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mm hmm so good, mm hmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip
What makes a good ol' boy start pumping his fist in the sky
What makes a shy girl walk on the wild side
What makes a party better
Makes it last forever
Everybody all together now
Take a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mm hmm so good, mm hmm so nice
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip
You can chug it down all you want
But you ain't gonna last long
Trust me you can get there with
Just a sip, just a sip
Beer or whiskey if you're with me, wet your lips
Gonna be mm hmm so good, mm hmm so right
Starting this night off so right with
Just a sip
Takin' one of them big ol' sips

TITLE: Pray About Everything
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Time is tight and money is short
River's up and the weatherman
He's calling for another storm
Pressure's on, the margins thin
Gotta figure out a fix for this awful fix I'm in
Oh mama, what am I gonna do?
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, pray about everything
Love is blind, fate don't care
Lose your grip and your balloons go sailing off into the air
Oh mama, what am I gonna do?
She said, "Child there's only one thing you can do"
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, yeah, pray about everything
Yeah, take a walk, take a breath, oh, give it all a rest
Take a cane pole to the fishing hole and catch a couple of fish
And just like that, toss 'em back and make a little wish
Yeah, yeah
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout it
Stress 'bout it, fret 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Let it go, see what tomorrow brings
Don't worry 'bout nothing
Pray about everything, yeah, pray about everything

TITLE: Bill Dance
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
This ain't no lie
Saved all my birthday money up
Put it down on a rod and reel
I got my green and tan Plano loaded up
Permission to fish behind that old sawmill
Mama said watch for snakes
Daddy said shut the gate
Brother said they're biting on the Zoom black and red flake
Laying in the bed that night
I swear I could barely sleep
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
While other boys were playing ball and knocking heads
I was floating on the Muckalee
While rebel kids were smoking, stealing cigarettes
I was fishing in them cypress trees
Paddle and a Jon boat, 9 pound, no joke
Got him in the net 'cause I didn't get my line broke
Using every trick in the book Daddy ever taught me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From a large mouth legend in a Tennessee hat
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
There's a lot of heroes out there these days
But if you ask me mine, there's only one name I'll say
Bill Dance, fishing for a living
Saturday morning on television
A Georgia boy learning how to hook big bass
From the best damn fisherman the world's ever had
Taught me how to tie 'em on
Taught me how to take 'em off
Taught me how to catch 'em when they said they couldn't be caught
Nobody ever had to worry about me
'Cause all I ever wanted to be was Bill Dance
Bill Dance
Yeah, the sun is just starting to shine up over the treetops
It's gonna be a beautiful day, it's plain to see

TITLE: Tailgate Blues
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and the warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell 'em what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues
I ain't sure were it all began
Somewhere 'round here I know
This bridge was a little more crowded then
I was playing her a tailgate show
And now I'm just sittin' here alone
To catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell them what I lost
Oh I've got the tailgate blues
Damn that AM radio
For playing more than a song
My heart won't beat if the strings are broke
The melody's hittin' me wrong
Right here where she belongs
I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell 'em what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues
The crickets heard my story and I listened to 'em sing
I guess I'll close the tailgate up
There ain't no telling what tomorrow might bring
Maybe me and a Dixie cup
But that won't be enough
Yes I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright
I search my soul where there is no moon
The trees all cross and are covered in moss
If the crickets wanna know then I'll tell them what I lost
Oh, I got the tailgate blues
I catch my buzz in the black of night
Where nobody ever goes and a warm wind blows
If I loose my cool in the open and it shows
That I'm down and I ain't alright

TITLE: Play It Again
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
She was sittin' all alone over on the tailgate
Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', "No way she ain't got one"
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off
She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance"
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around 'til it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
I'd a gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later we were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM, too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up
She was like, "Oh, my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is"
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance"
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
The next Friday night
We were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile
When I broke out my guitar
She was like, "Oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round, waitin' for it to come on and here it is"
She was like, "Come here boy, I wanna dance"
'Fore I said a word she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And she said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
And I said, "Play it again, play it again, play it again"
Yeah, play it again, play it again, play it again
Somebody, play it again, play it again, play it again

Late I buy stumble a few thousand beers in my day
You put down twice as many
No telling how many burn fires have lit up my face
If they ain't hundreds, it ain't many

Being watched on my friends
Havin' the time of your life
There's somethin' in this Spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up bright

Once you're sconed, you can't get it back
So leave a mark, y'all, where you at

This ain't the first time we've partied under the stars
Making a hung over

For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer

TITLE: Blood Brothers
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
We were as young as we were dumb
When we piled in a ol' pile of junk
It was one for all, and all for one
A bunch of outlaws without a gun
Shootin' bad booze outta dixie cups
Chasin' every girl that wasn't fast enough
No matter how bad the break or how bad the luck
Or how bad the day we still had us
Blood brothers closer than your next of kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers
I got a scar on my cheek from a bar room brawl
Wasn't meant for me but I took the fall
It's a cowboy code it's an unwrote law
If you mess with one you gotta take us all
Blood brother's closer than your next of kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed
And you lean on one another
Blood brothers, yeah
Time can fly on by
Everything can change
But 'til the day we die
We'll always remain
Yeah, we'll remain
Yeah yeah yeah
Blood brothers closer than you next of kin
Thick as thieves and the best of friends
Take a bullet for each other
Yeah brothers a light that don't come cheap
You fight, you cry, you lie, you bleed

TITLE: Drink A Beer

LYRICS:
When I got the news today
I didn't know what to say
So I just hung up the phone
I took a walk to clear my head
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Then watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Funny how the good ones go
Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense
So I'm gonna sit right here
On the edge of this pier
Then watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
So long my friend, until we meet again
I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to
Sit right here on the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer
Drink a beer
Drink a beer, yeah

TITLE: Razor Blade
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
You're not looking for anything more than a
Good time and an open door
A good band and a dance floor
Then she walks in
You got a pickup line to throw, but
She walks up and says "Hello"
Before you can even let it go
She's got you reeled in
You can't escape it if you wanted to, you don't
Know what you got yourself into
You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You wait
Used to playing by these rules
So you sit there and try to play it cool
Do your best not to play the fool
But it's too late now
You wanna see how far she'll let you go
She'll let you think you're in control
You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife
That little look in her eyes'll
Cut you like a razor blade
You can't escape it if you wanted to, you don't
Know what you got yourself into
You're blindfolded walking
South down the whiskey tracks
She's rolling north like a neon train
Bolt of lightning in the night
Speed of light, you won't realize
You've been struck 'til you see the flame
Her smile'll slash you to the heart
There you are in the back of a bar
Bleeding, but you feel no pain
She won't cut you like a knife, like a knife

TITLE: Love Me In A Field
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Don't need a hotel or a high rise
A big old bunk with a fancy name
I don't need a backseat, don't need no rusty truck
We could leave that dust on that old porch swing
Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out on the rye grass lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Oh baby love me in a field
Now we got that California king
In the back of that Georgia double wire
And I'm about to bust out the seams
When I get you to the country side
What's that sound like to you?
Cuz it sounds dang good to me
Just hit me with a smile when you're ready to leave
Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field
Find an old pasture
Where the cows ain't
Been for a while
Wanna see your blue eyes
Where the flowers go wild
Little after midnight
Morning dew
On our skin
Promise you won't nobody, nobody know where we've been
Let's get tangled in the tassels of some ten foot corn
Tear our t-shirts in the cotton patch behind the barn
Get lost out in the rye grass lay a blanket in the beets
Tear up some turnip greens on some river bottom ground
Or find some muscadines up on a hill
Baby, love me in a field
Love me in a field
Love me in a field
In a big ol' field

Yeah, it don't happen like it used to happen
But when it does, I twist off the cap
And drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
No more 2 a.m. phone calls to act like I'm checkin' in
No more runnin' the other way when I run into your friends
I don't need your touch, need your smile
Except for every little once in awhile
Then I drink a little whiskey, drink a little whiskey down
When the wonderin' if you miss me, missin' you comes around

Seems all we got left is Friday and Saturday night 
And sometimes Sunday if Monday is a holiday.
I got a bunch of buddies I ain't seen in a while,
I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile, 
With some home brew, Malibu and Miller Lite.
Girl put on that short little party dress and make me a little bit jealous. 
It's gonna be a wild weekend,
Been on the phone with all my friends.
There's a little spot in the river bend
Were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg don't float and the ice don't melt, 
We'll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet we'll fall in love again and again and again.
It's gonna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
It's Friday afternoon and the countdowns on, 
Cell phone's singin' that All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight,
Bad to the bone rington, 
Come on, come on, come on, baby let's get gone.
It's bumper to bumper in the outbound,
And we're already gettin' down.

TITLE: Most People Are Good
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I believe kids oughta stay kids
As long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree
Get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
'Cause nobody gets a second chance
To make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights
Look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe them streets of gold
Are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go
Even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
'Cause wisdom in your teens
Would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind
Would be the first thing you lose
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights
Look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe that days go slow
And years go fast
And every breath's a gift
The first one to the last
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights
Look better under neon or stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe most people are good

TITLE: Win Life
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Ain't tryna to be hero
Just tryna cash a paycheck
'Til the clock hits zero
Make the most of these days left
Found a few shortcuts
Picked up a couple secrets
Don't have it figured out yet
But I've learned the hard way, it's...
More drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Just trying to win life
Man, in a couple scrapes, I... barely got out of
Got a couple scars, I... kinda ain't proud of
But you can't be afraid to drive until the gas can's empty
And if you're glass is half full, you better make damn sure it's whiskey
And be more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
Watching those numbers on the scoreboard clock unwind
Still trying to win life
But if you lose yourself in someone else
Than maybe you don't lose at all
Just be more more drunk in love and habits kicked
More miracles than magic tricks
More green grass grows, and green old dollar bills
More babies raised, and raising hell
More get back up, sometimes you fail
Well, I don't know it all
Hey, but I know how it feels
To be the guy that's trying to come back from behind
And that hail Mary's coming down on the five yard line
And I'm trying to win life
Just trying to win life
I'll be trying to win life

I saw a truck backin' out of your drive
You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin' with the radio, you had your sun glasses on
I pulled over cause I couldn't believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, just singing our songs
Everybody round our towns been whisperin'
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin'
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain't leaving till I hear you say what's going on
It'll be what it will be, it's either him or me
Give me the word and girl I'm gone
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It's driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don't try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
Goodbye's never easy
So break it to me hard
If you're over my love girl

TITLE: Just Over
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
She called and said she wanted to see me
I say, "Yeah, that's fine, baby, drop on by"
I figured I could make it better
Just like every other time we had this fight
Of all the kind of over it could've been
I never would've bet on this
I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over it's just over
When she left the kitchen, she left no questions
I said where in the world did I go wrong?
And it don't matter where she's headed
She's gone, gone, gone
I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on, she's gone
She ain't pulling over it's just over
Like the page, she's turning over
Like the light, she's starting over
Without me
I was thinking she would come over, stay over
Wake up hungover, still head over heels for me
Thought it was something we could talk over, drink over
Then it would be over, back to how it used to be
No, but it's the kind where the sheets get colder
And she don't need no shoulder to cry on
She's gone, she ain't pulling over, it's just over
It's just over
Yeah, it's just over
It's just over

TITLE: Stuck On You
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I hear you found one 
Heard he's a good one 
Livin out all your dreams 
Give it some time girl
I hear you found one
Heard he's a good one
Livin out all your dreams
Give it some time girl
You'll come to find
You shoulda just stuck with me
When it don't work out
And then he walks out
Before you look for number 3
Stop for a second
Maybe you'll reckon
You shoulda just stuck with me
I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
I'd do anything for you
You might believe that your over me
But I'm still stuck on you
I keep on hopin'
You had to go just so you could spread your wings
But come some sunrise
You'll come to realize
You shoulda just stuck with me
I know I ain't perfect but least I've learned
I'd do anything for you
You might believe that your over me
But I'm still stuck on you
We're gonna look back
We're gonna laugh bout
Our ups and downs and in betweens
When you said goodbye and then you realized
Shoulda just stuck with me
Give it some time girl
You'll come to find
You shoulda just stuck with me

Bunch of buddies in John Deere hats 
A little crazy but they got my back 
Know every roll-through, stop sign, like the back of my hand 
And every bank, where the fish will bite
Bunch of buddies in John Deere hats
A little crazy but they got my back
Know every roll-through, stop sign, like the back of my hand
And every bank, where the fish will bite
Still like putting a smile on the face
Of a girl I've known since the second grade
Got a kiss that's sweet like lemonade
She's everything I'll ever need
Another reason I'll never leave
Born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here
Just like my daddy, and his daddy did too
Ride the same roads, work the same dirt
Go to the same church and drink the same beer
Born here, live here, die here
Yeah
Everybody's gotta find their place
Some dreams you catch, some dreams you chase
Some people run and some people stay
Me, I'll always be
Born here, live here, die here
From the roots, to the boots, to the lay me down suit
Yeah, I'm gonna be proud to be right here

I know this town like the back of my hand
Every back road, every turn road
Baby, where you wanna go?
Get you there with my eyes closed
Just pick the spot, say the word
Baby, what you got?
It might be my Chevrolet, but tonight you're calling the shots
We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights
Yeah, I might be the one behind the wheel
But you're driving this thing tonight
You're driving this thing tonight
Been waiting all day just to see what you got on
Is it your high heels, your blue jeans?
Maybe that red dress, or climing up in your bare feet
I'll put the pedal down, but baby, you got the keys
We can go uptown, show out
Spend every dime in my pocket
We can hit the outskirts, red dirt
Riding these roads like a rocket
You can be my freeway DJ
Just tell me where to point these lights

ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Hey girl, go on now!
You know you've got everybody lookin'
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love
Get up on the hood of my daddy's tractor
Up on the tool box, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate
Girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl
Aw, country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Somebody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony-tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile
So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma's yarn
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Country girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Girl, shake it for me
Guitar
Now dance, like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines
Yeah, move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you
And get to knowin' you
And get to showin' you
And get to lovin' you
'Fore the night is through
Baby, you know what to do
Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song

TITLE: What Country Is
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
There's a house fly swimmin' in my sweet tea
Hey darlin' pass another Kerr jar to me
Butter drippin' off a biscuit, baby better take a bite
Cantaloupe thumps like it's finally ripe
Box fan on a lawn chair suckin' in swamp air
Two hundred mile marker signs from nowhere
That's what country is
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is
When the sun starts slippin' from the delta sky
And the last scarecrow tucks in for the night
Make a fire throw a blanket on the sandy bank
'Bout an hour 'till we feel the first catfish yank
Barefoot cane pole wavin' at the riverboats
And when they're gone take a dip in the moon glow
That's what country is
It ain't a rebel flag you bought at the mall
It's a hide away bed in an old horse stall
Two kids gettin' caught stealin' a Boone's farm kiss
It ain't a John Deere cap that's never fell in the cotton
It's a Jimmy Rodgers song that was long forgotten
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
That's what country is
It ain't a jacked up truck that's never seen a pasture
It's cars pulling over for a no-cab tractor
It's homemade peach ice cream on sunburnt lips
No, it can't be bought it's somethin' you're born with
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is
That's what country is

TITLE: What Makes You Country
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
People talkin' 'bout what is and what ain't country 
What gives 'em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots? 
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies? 
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth
People talkin' 'bout what is and what ain't country
What gives 'em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin' on the rain
We're all a little different, but we're all the same
Everybody doin' their own thing
I got my dirt road cred when I was twelve
On a no cap tractor halling in bales
Backing in boats, fishing landlines
Running bird docks through the Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
Just be proud of what makes you country
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Where you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
That feels so right
Did you lock eyes with a little green eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a level church
Silver cream corn in a backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab by gun and get my outside on
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
Just be proud of what makes you country
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear in on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
You know you gotta let it out
I got my dirt road cred back when I was twelve
On a no cap tractor halling in bales
Backing in boats, fishing land lines
Running bird docks through them Georgia pines
Step side cover down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
And just be proud of what makes you country
Whatever makes you country
You do your kinda country
They doing they kind of country
I do my kind of country
Whatever makes us country

TITLE: Five O'Clock Angel
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Every morning of everyday
I wake up it's the same ol thing
Fight the traffic, punch the clock.
Concrete floors wearing out my shoes
Tired of feeling the way I do.
Three more trucks to load, it never stops.
They're killin' me from nine to five
When it's quitting time, I come alive.
Cause I gotta woman
Who holds me in her arms and understands
A beautiful woman
Who knows how hard it is to be a man.
No telling where I'd be right now
If she hadn't been sent down
So I don't have to face this world all by myself
She's my five o'clock angel.
I'm like a branded man down where I work
The company name sewn on my shirt
They can buy my time, but they don't own me.
There's more to me than what I do
I've got feelings, too.
There's somewhere else I'd rather be.
You can have your beer and whiskey sour.
I don't need no Happy Hour.
Cause I got a woman
Who holds me in her arms and understands
A beatiful woman
Who knows how hard it is to be a man
No telling where I'd be right now
If she hadn't been sent down
So I don't have to face this world all by myself
She's my five o'clock angel.
No telling where I'd be right now
If she hadn't been sent down
So I don't have to face this world all by myself
She's my five o'clock angel
My five o'clock angel

It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em. 
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light 
And I don't mind telling all the guys "I can't meet 'em". 
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
It don't matter what plans I got, I can break 'em.
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I don't mind telling all the guys "I can't meet 'em".
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I don't care, oh I just gotta see what you're wearing.
Your hair, is I put up or falling down?
Oh I just have to see it now.
If you wanna call me, call me, call me you don't have to worry 'bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that's alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.
The door's unlocked, I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.
Ain't a spot downtown that's rockin' the way that you rock me.
Ain't a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do.
I could be on the front row of the best show.
And look down and see your face on my phone.
And I'm gone so long, hang on. I'll meet you in a minute or two.
If you wanna call me, call me, call me you don't have to worry 'bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that's alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.
The door's unlocked. I'll leave on the lights
Baby you can crash my party anytime.
If it's 2 in the morning and you're feeling lonely and wondering what I'm doing.
Go ahead and call me, call me, call me you don't have to worry 'bout it baby.
You can wake me up in the dead of the night; wreck my plans, baby that's alright.
This is a drop everything kind of thing.
Swing on by I will pour you a drink.

TITLE: It's A Shore Thing
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
There's a fifty-fifty chance
That the room ain't ready
Odds are, the cooler's too heavy,
To tote down to the beach all by myself
I'd be willing to bet,
By the end of the week
I'll pass out in room 319
And to round up all my clothes
I might need a little help
But it's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
I think it's safe to say
I'll make a few new friends
Take us out at a bar
Throw a beer on the band
Toss down head into a parking lot road
And I wouldn't be surprised
If my ex shows up
Huggin' all over some dude in his truck
I guess down here
That's the way things go
But I'll be fine
'Cause all I know
It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight

TITLE: Tackle Box
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
It was two shades of brown and scratched up plastic
It held extra line, lures, hooks, and matches
And his last name engraved in black
Right there by the handle on the top
I'd slide it out of the back of his station wagon
Lug it down the bank with my arm draggin'
And I could hardly wait for him
To lift the lid on that tackle box
'Cause I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battle ship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to grandma, cryin' on the dock
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box
He'd bait my hook and keep on tellin' stories
'Bout nickel cokes, girls, and sandlot glories
Pickup trucks and peanut fields
Long before this town knew blacktop
I was almost ridin' with him shotgun down those dirt roads
Takin' turns on a jug of homemade shine
As he raced his buddies down through Mason Holler
Fillin' the sky with dust and kicked up rocks
He opened up, every time he opened up 
That old tackle box
He's been gone twenty years tomorrow
And I'm still holdin' on to this one wish
That God above would let me borrow grandpa
For one more afternoon and one more fish
And I'd sail with him across the South Pacific
Stand beside him on the bow of that battle ship
See him kiss the ground and thank the good Lord Jesus
And watch him run to grandma, cryin' on the dock 
He opened up, every time he opened up
That old tackle box
Yeah, sure I love
Every time he opened up
That old tackle box

Only thing better than one is two boats
Big church, small church
Come one, come all church
New sound, old sound
Small town, old town
If you're drinking, better have enough for the whole town
Red dirt, clay dirt
Trying to get to pay dirt
Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked and the corn grows thick 
And the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here, the good old days ain't far away
'Cause they can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name
Proud of the mud running through your veins
They say nothing don't ever stay the way it was
But country does
Country does
Old folks, kinfolks
Those folks, them folks
Talk about us, gonna take it on the chin folks
Farm work, hard work
Kids do the yardwork
Slow song, sad song
Growing up on dad's songs
Long as there's fiddle, hell, there really ain't a bad song
Cold beer, cheap beer
Plant our roots and our boots and our feet here
Country did as country does
Long as the salt gets licked and the corn grows thick 
And the sun comes up
Country is as country was
And 'round here the good old days ain't far away 
'Cause you can't change us
Proud of your family, proud of your name

High on a hill lookin' at a field downwind
If I could make a nickel off a turning 'em bass
Never worry about the price of gas

Early in the mornin' and late in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River pay
Huntin' and fishin' and lovin' every day

Sound of gravel when I back it up
And pullin' the string on a nine point nine two stroke

I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
And we'd get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day

Huntin', Fishin', Lovin' everyday
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Y'all close them eyes
And lets go there in our minds
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin' and dark whiskey in the evenin'
I get red dirt rich and Flint River pay

Won't you come along with me
I know you'll wanna see

To come and warm you up up in that cold hayloft

Can't get these kind of muscles anywhere but a farm
Hey, I'm a country man 
A city boy can't do the things I can

That way nobody sees us parked back up in these trees
Your little ipod loaded down with Hoobastank
Don't be a tape player hater girl were groovin' to Hank

But girl I'm here to tell you don't believe the hype
Hey, I'm a country man

TITLE: Dirt Road Diary
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Me and daddy'd ride around all day shooting doves off a line in a Chevrolet.
Old lab would jump out the back and fetch them up.
We'd drive for miles and miles and never once hit blacktop or change the dial.
One little country station was all there was.
Checking gates, fixing fence rows – that's how my story goes.
If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary.
It's right there for you to see, every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory.
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridin' round, windows down on a summer night.
I was there, and that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.
I remember when I turned sixteen I got a license and some gasoline.
Ain't a curve or a straight away we didn't fly down.
If wasn't the boys it was me and her by fire in a field or down on the river.
Every inch of that county was sacred ground.
I wish I knew where that old truck was.
If it could talk it could tell on us.
If you want to know the real me, just turn the page in my dirt road diary.
It's right there for you to see, every kiss, every beer, every cotton field memory.
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridin' round, windows down on a summer night.
I was there, and that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.
It ain't a book underneath my bed;
Just a dusty memory lane burned in my head.
Tan legs and some Dixie Land delight, ridin' round, windows down feeling right
I was there, that was me. It's right here in my dirt road diary.
Just ride around my little town and you'll see how I wrote my dirt road diary.

You're like a screen flashing insufficient funds
Cops knocking when the party's just begun
You're a big rain cloud parked over my boat
You're a cell phone splashing in my coffee cup
A fumble on the one when my team was going up
You're like brakes on my brain and all I know
You're a buzzkill every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill Baby, you're a buzzkill
I used to do everything I could do to do nice things
No matter what I did or didn't do it didn't change
Everybody knows you ended us
So, while you're showing up here on my side of the tracks
Slipping in this barn just to check out where I'm at
I was a six pack in, now I'm sober as a judge
'Cause you're a buzzkill every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out
Why are you still showing up and bringing me down?
Why do I keep letting you get to me
And mess up what that's not what's gonna be?
You walk right by crashing my high like I know you will
You little buzzkill
'Cause if it didn't hurt enough now I got to see you flirt
Nailed to the stool, watching you work
Don't you give a damn about how I feel
You little brown haired, blue eyed, beautiful buzzkill
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're such buzzkill
Yea, you're a buzzkill every time you come around
Those beers might as well have been poured out

There's a bonfire burning
Got Bocephus blaring 
Louder than allowed out in our neck of the neighborhood
If you wanna see follow me over the river through the woods
When the bugs and the beer start biting
There's bound to be some friendly fighting
Usually little Becky Lee winds up jumpin' up on somebody's hood
Don't she dance good?
Join the crowd gather round
Over the river through the woods
Just follow my tail lights out past the streetlights 
A left then a hard right, they're goin' all night
We'll do a little what we want 
After one long week of doin what we should
Over the river and through the woods
At first I thought she was kiddin 
When she mentioned skinny dipping
She said follow me through the trees 
Yes siree unless I misunderstood
We'll splash and splish with the fish 
Over the river and through the woods
That's my beer can next to her beer can 
Next to my work pants up there on dry land
We'll do a little what we want 
After one long week of doin what we should
Over the river and through the woods
That's my sore head layin on my truck bed 
Eyes blood shot red hearing what my mama said
We did a little what we want 
After one long week of doing what we should
Over the river and through the woods
Yeah, over the river and through the woods

TITLE: Your Goodbye Wasn't Good Enough
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Standin' right there, awake and aware, 
I heard the words right off your lips. 
The meanin' was clear, I saw the tears, 
But somehow the message didn't click.
Standin' right there, awake and aware,
I heard the words right off your lips.
The meanin' was clear, I saw the tears,
But somehow the message didn't click.
The losin' you part, the break in my heart, just didn't stick.
1
Girl your, goodbye wasn't good enough.
I'm as in to you as I ever was.
If you'd a done it right, then why ain't I the love.
Must be because, your goodbye wasn't good enough.
Some look in your eye, says there's still time,
Maybe there's one more last chance left.
What you didn't say, when you turned away,
Made me hang on by one more thread.
That shadow of hope, that whisper of smoke, is still in my head.
2
Girl your, goodbye wasn't good enough.
I'm as in to you as I ever was.
If you'd a done it right, then why ain't I the love.
Must be because, your goodbye wasn't
Good enough to make me see, I don't need you, and you don't need me.

TITLE: That Don't Just Happen
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Rocks bang together 
Things start blowing up 
Planets all align around a big red sun 
Then we're all here
Rocks bang together
Things start blowing up
Planets all align around a big red sun
Then we're all here
That don't just happen
Two tiny sails collide
Then she feels a kick
Soon the baby cries and your going home with him
Then he says daddy
That don't just happen
You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen
Crops are in the field
There aren't no rain nowhere
Ground is cracks and dust
The whole town is in despair
Then a farmer prays and the storms roll in
That don't just happen
Oh, You can take what you read in a book
Take what you see on a TV screen
Throw it out the window and look
At how the sky is blue and the grass is green
And when the stars come out every night
That don't just happen
Every time we take a deep breath
And every time that the wheels touchdown
Every time we take another step
And have one more day to hang around
Know we didn't get that lucky
Cause that don't just happen
That don't just happen
Someone picked you out
Put you in front of me
In a smoky college bar
The rest is history
That don't just happen

TITLE: You Look Like Rain
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
You and your Sunday mornings
Me and my Saturday nights
You and all your colors
Me and my black and whites
You and your lace and cotton
Up against my whiskey skin
Saving me the way you always do it
'Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins and the gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
You and your stained glass windows
Me and my cracked windshield
You and your quiet view
Me and my can't sit still
'Cause I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins and the gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
Girl I'm hell up here on the high wire
You're the hallelujah kind
I'm the dust that spins and the gust of wind that's blowing by
I'm a desert dry
And in my thirsty eyes
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You look like rain
You're my sweet rain

I know, I know it, baby
Sounds like your day's been crazy
I just wanna hold ya
All the weight that's on your shoulders
Anything that's wrong
Let me, let me love it gone
Come on and trust me, honey
I can turn those raindrops sunny
Let me untie that tangle
Put on that kissing angel good morning song
Let me, let me love it gone
Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
Got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list
Girl, I want, I want I wanna get lost in your lipstick
Oh, baby, let me love it, let me, let me love it
Let me, let me love it gone
Why don't you slip into
Little something off the secret menu
Kick back, and let down your hair
Yeah, that one right there looks so damn good on
Let me, let me love it gone
Little barefoot dancing
Little kissing in the kitchen romancing
I got a whole lot of love that I've been saving
And a bottle of wine that's been waiting
Long time for a night like this
Whatever's wrong, shake it off your list

ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
We got beer, and a tub,
And some good lookin' girls
Dressed to the nights,
Lookin' for a good time
Jacked up trucks, stacked in thick
White rocks stuck, in the mud grips
And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D.
And don't you dare step out on the floor
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you ain't here to party
There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playin' a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Lookin' so fine shakin' that thang
In the zydeco cage and purple rain
Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along
Man, you're here all alone
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone

So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Goin' home alone is
If you ain't here to party
Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Throw your keys on the bar
You ain't drivin' your car

That's how it's gonna be
'Cause we're here to party, baby

TITLE: Scarecrows
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
We didn't have no downtown strip
We'd all pile in and take a two mile trip
To where the road runs out
Sit there and sip on whatever anybody's older brother could get
Where we worked in the dirt and fell in love
Got my heart broke, broke down my truck
Trying to spin out, show off in that mud too many times
So much has changed
But then again, it ain't
Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
I don't get back near enough
And just like these fields yeah, we all grow up
And it takes a little more than a paper cup to get dizzy
This hundred acre stretch is buried in my bones
Don't matter how long that I've been gone
I can be anywhere and some song comes on
And it's like I never left home
Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around every Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
So much has changed
But then again, it ain't
Just like the scarecrows, even when the wind blows
We keep our boots and our roots in these cornrows
Where we threw down and we passed it around on a Friday night
Just some old plowboys pretending we're cowboys
We came from nothing, oh, but look at us now, boys
Even when we leave here, we'll always be here, wherever we go
Just like the scarecrows
Just like the scarecrows

TITLE: You Don't Know Jack
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
He asked me for a dollar, I said "Go get a job"
I turned up my collar and started walkin' off
He said "I don't blame you, I know what you think
I'd just spend your money, to buy another drink"
But you don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack
He showed me a picture, of two little girls
Wearin' Easter dresses, hair done up in curls
He said "God bless their mamma
She said I couldn't stay
And buddy if you're wonderin'
How could I throw it all away"
You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
And you can't go back
To your life, and your kids, and your ex-wife
With just a telephone call
If you think it's just a bottle
In an old brown paper sack
You don't know Jack
If you never felt the fire
Running through your veins
If you've never seen the devil
Face to face
You don't know Jack
Double shot, eighty proof, on the rocks
Until you've lost it all
So brother just be glad, and tonight
Hold your kids, kiss your wife
And when you talk to God
Count up all your blessings
And thank the good Lord that
You don't know Jack
You don't know Jack

TITLE: Shut It Down
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
She likes to watch him out the window 
Goin' 'round in circles under the sun 
Somethin' 'bout a man on a tractor 
With his hat on backwards
She likes to watch him out the window
Goin' 'round in circles under the sun
Somethin' 'bout a man on a tractor
With his hat on backwards
Lookin' forward to after he's done
He keeps his eye on the back porch
She walks out, kicks off her shoes
Bare feet standin' in the short grass
Sweet ice tea in a tall glass
Judgin' by her smile, it's about time to
Lotta work left to do, the sun's still out
But any hay to make can wait for now
Throttle back, drop the plow
He wipes his face off with his t-shirt
Climbs down and meets her by the gate
Takes himself a long, cool sip
Lays some sugar on her lips
Thinkin' maybe he oughta just call it a day
Lotta work left to do, the sun's still out
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Ooh, big, blue sky, half-plowed field
Bird on a fender, tractor sittin' still
Any hay to make can wait for now
Take it on in the house
Close the door, lock it out, lock it out
Shut it down, shut it down, shut it down

Through the dirt and the gravel
Through the years and the miles
Every road that you traveled
Through the tears and the smiles
Through the clear and the muddy
Through the thick and thin
The quiet nights, the howling wind
Through the good and the ugly
The blue and the black
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Through all of the words
The mean and the kind
Through the strings that unravel
And the ties that bind
From the crazy and the different
To the more of the same
From the coast is clear
To a hurricane
Yeah, I'll be right beside you
On a roll or off the tracks
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
To the moon and back
Through the bitter and the sweet
The cold and the fire
Lonely cotton sheets
And the burning desire
Until our song is over
Til the stars all fade to black
I'm gonna love you
To the ends of the Earth
To the moon and back
Yeah, I'm gonna love you
All the way to the moon and back
To the moon and back

TITLE: Better Than My Heart
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I'm feeling kind of banged up
Slow out of the bed
Neon noise and honkey-tonk wine ringing in my head
Last night I saw your car
I overheard your name
Pulled my hat down low, wouldn't want you to know I was in this shape
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
You filled it with your love
Then you drained it out
Sometimes I think you built it up
Just to break it down
Now that's really left
Is an emptiness inside
A river running cold, memories growing old
Dying right there on the vine
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Now these old beer bones
Are like a rusty old plow
These cigarettes eyes are
'Bout to burn out
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
These whiskey worn lips can't muster up a smile
The soles on my boots have walked their last mile
But they're still doing better
Better than my heart
Yeah, they're still doing better
Better than my heart

Yeah, I know that color on your lips too well.
I saw you blowing kisses down the wishing well again.
When I say I love you, just just say "I know."
You put your arms around me, but it's all for show.
And then, there you go wrecking my whole world.
All fixed up, my goodbye girl.
You scatter in the wind just like a dandelion.
Reminding me again that you ain't ever mine for long.
But I know it's gonna happen when the moon is right,
You'll show up at my door and pull me in just like a song.
There you go, wrecking my whole world.
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl.
It might seem crazy to keep loving you this way,
But I'll never bring myself to say goodbye, girl.
The sun is gonna make it's way around again,
But the rain is always waiting just around the bend.
And there you go, wrecking my whole world.
One more hello, one more goodbye, girl.
All fixed up, my goodbye girl.

T flows underneath the 32 bridge.
It cuts through the heart of south Georiga.
Big copper heads, and mean wild pigs.
And gator's in the weeds, waitin' for ya.
I leave my phone in the truck.
I leave my truck at the road.
My four-wheeler gets me to where I wanna go.
I leave the world behind, I pull my hat down low.
Get back to my roots, by a full moon glow.
I got an old John boat that I stow down there, on them hot summer nights,
When I get a wild hair.
I got a moonshine stash, in a side rest stump.
And a catfish line goin' thump thump
And old tractor tire, when I sit by the fire.
And drink to a sweet swamp song.
So if you're looking for me, don't even bother.
When I dip my feet in that Muckalee Creek Water.

TITLE: Little Boys Grow Up And Dogs Get Old
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Bandit was a black lab, Daddy brought home
He said, son he's yours from now on
Bandit looked at me and he cocked his head
Slept at night on the foot of my bed
All that year, I can see him still
Chasing after me, nipping at my heels
Down to the bus stop, my new best friend
Still waiting right there when I got home again
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
I guess I just didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old
He was my sidekick through thick and thin
And he'd bark at my fish when I'd reel 'em in
Summers came and went and we grew like weeds
And I don't know if I raised him or he raised me
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
How was I supposed to know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old
He was fourteen when I left for Tennessee
And he came down the front porch steps a little slow
I got down to hug his neck
Said, you take care of Mom and Dad, 'til I get home
Be a good boy
Now you be a good boy
And I thought we would be together
Go on and on just like that, forever
But I was young back then
God I wish I didn't know
Little boys grow up and dogs get old

I've been watching and talked down to you all night long
Girl it's so wrong
How we, don't even wanna dance with you
Flipping through his phone like he don't even see
You're too pretty to left alone
Sooner or later somebody's gonna take you home
Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
You can sit there letting time pass
Looking at your nails, staring down in your glass
Or you can just look up my way
See me wanting you, written on my face
I ain't gonna tell you what you wanna do
'Cause you gonna do what you wanna do
Are you leaving with him
Are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do
Are you really leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
It's the last song of the night
You take a sip and we locked eyes
Are you leaving with him
Or are you leaving with me
I'm looking for my end, and it's all in
While he's just waiting for the night to end
I ain't never seen nothing like you
But I got it in my mind what I wanna do

TITLE: Sunburnt Lips
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Back again in the back of this pasture
Sweatin' bad in the cab of this tractor
I oughta be worried about the rain
The last hundred rows could've been a little straighter
Guess I'll be hittin' them again later
I could turn this red dirt all day, yeah
Dreamin' 'bout sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Behind the dust is a big ol' blue sky
Kinda reminds me of those blue eyes smilin' back at me
I slide up a gear and go a little faster
Just a little breeze and I'm right back there
And I can almost feel
Her sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Oh, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips, sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, all summer long
We were tangled up in a blanket on the sand
And the moonlight, watchin' that tide roll in
Her skin on mine, the only thing I got on my mind
Is a two-piece memory of her and me layin' on the beach
And one sweet, sweet memory of layin' on the beach
With her sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips
Sunburnt lips on me, yeah, her sunburnt lips

TITLE: What Is It With You
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Girl, there ain't no way you don't know how pretty you are 
Every mirror in this two lane town knows the trouble you cause 
I'd give anything to take that beer back I sent your way 
I should've just took a shot of warm whiskey and called it a day
Girl, there ain't no way you don't know how pretty you are
Every mirror in this two lane town knows the trouble you cause
I'd give anything to take that beer back I sent your way
I should've just took a shot of warm whiskey and called it a day
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Ah, are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you
I spent half the day all hungover the morning after your kiss
I knew the second that you showed up, baby, it'd be another week of this
I keep prayin' that you might've left something
Something when you got undressed
Something that you wanna come back for
Whatever you can do to get me back in your mess
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
Are we in, are we out, why you runnin' me around
Why you havin' such a damn hard time, girl, with the truth
What is it with you
Oh, I ain't me, I ain't right
But I'll admit I kinda like all the heaven and hell that you put me through
What is it with you
Girl, you make me wanna love, you make me wanna hate
Is it the thrill of the chase or just something you do
What is it with you
What is it with you
Oh, what is it with you

Oh
Oh
What you doin' in this place?
(Well, I could probably ask you the same thing)
Another round, girl, what you think?
(If you're buying, well, you know I'll drink, some, make it 707)
Do you want it on the rocks?
(A double shot of heaven)
Spilling out the top
And we'll go
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(I'll send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
Slow country from a cover band
(I got you covered if you don't know how to dance
But if you want we could grab a cab)
Girl, we got all night, I got a bottomless tab so let's go
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
So put your drink down, throw your camera up
Flip it around and snap a payback picture
(I'll send it to my ex)
I'll send it to my ex
And send them both a text saying
"We ain't going home alone tonight"
Girl you ain't gotta, I ain't gotta go
Home alone tonight
It feels too good to let it end right here
I ain't going home alone tonight
(So, let's not let it end, let it end right here)
Girl, you're going home with me, so let's go
Shot, for shot, for shot
'Til we forgot what we came here to forget
Ain't a clock, a tick, a tock, that's gonna stop
A night we won't regret
Put your drink down, throw your camera up

TITLE: Love In A College Town
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Girl I'll be over there
With my buddies drinkin' beer
If you need me, come and get me
When you hear our song
In a little while
When you're ready shoot me that smile
That way I'll know, that its time to go
You got your buzz on
We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothin' like love in a college town
All the rumors fly
Did you here who hooked up last night?
Thought she was all about, cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
There's old what's his name
He just can't seem to graduate
Hittin' on the new crop, buyin' 'em lemon drops
Man that's just wrong
We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town
I'm gonna fail this test
Thinking 'bout your dress
Layin' on my floor
Runnin' out the door
8.8 BAC, that sounds good to me
We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's give it one more shot
Baby how's that sound?
Hug on one another, kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town
Gotta' love love in a college town

I watch you tell everyone
That she is your only one
But I see the other side
Know all the things you try to hide
Man, you put you up a real good front
You thinking you've got everyone
But you ain't got me fooled
I see right through
If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true
If you ain't gonna love her like you say you do
Then I wanna love her like you say you do
Think you go as simple as you walk away
There ain't too much you even gotta say
You don't have to hurt her anymore
It's just a turnin' of a door
And don't you worry about bein' gone
'Cause she won't want for nothing too long
'Cause I see what you couldn't see
And I wanna be what you wouldn't be
If you love her like you say you do
Then why don't you love her like you say you do
'Cause I wanna love her like you say you do
If you ain't gonna treat her right
Then don't make her lie awake another night
Waitin' on another dream that just ain't comin' true

TITLE: Kick The Dust Up
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Kick the dust up
All week long it's a farming town, they're making that money grow
Tractors, plows with flashing lights backing up a two lane road
They take one last lap around
That sun up high goes down
And that song come on girl kick it on back, Z71 like a Cadillac
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a
Four door burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now, better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
Let's tear it up up
And kick the dust up
Bar downtown they got a line of people way out the door
10 dollar drinks, it's packed inside
I don't know what they're waiting for
Got me a jar full of 'Clear, and I got that music for your ears
And it's like knock, knock, knock goes the diesel
If you really wanna see the beautiful people
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a
Four door burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now, better have your boots on
Kick the dust up
Let's back it on up
Fill your cup up
Lets tear it up up
And kick the dust up
Come on
Just follow me down 'neath the 32 bridge you oughta be glad you did
Kick it
We go way out where there ain't nobody
We turn this cornfield into a party
Pedal to the floorboard end up in a
Four door burning up a backroad song
Park it and we pile out
Baby watch your step now
Better have your boots on
Kick the dust up (kick the dust up)
Back it on up
Fill your cup up
That's what's up up
Let's kick the dust up

TITLE: Way Way Back
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Hey, baby, it's been a minute since
Me and you got caught up in a little wild and young
Kinda reckless love
That song that was playing when we first kissed
Yeah, you probably don't think I remember it
Got it in the truck
I can dial it up
Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it
Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Baby, don't try to hide that smile
I can see that memory in your mind
Running all around
We can chase it down
You look even better than you did back then, girl
Close your eyes and we'll be there in no time
And we can rewind it
Way, way, back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Like an old school song
Two of us just hanging on to the night
Wouldn't you like to go there, baby?
Every little scratch on that CD
Made it skip along like my heartbeat did back then
Baby, hop in, we can take it
Way, way back
Find that no-name road
Cross those boxcar tracks
Where we used to go
And lay it way, way, back
Let the moonshine through
Kissing you like yesterday
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back
Like it wasn't all that way, way back
Way, way back

TITLE: Build Me A Daddy
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
A boy walks past a window of a glowin' open sign
Full of wooden toys and trucks and painted trains
Rings a bell up on the counter, hands a picture to the man
Of a kid beside a soldier smiling away
Said, "Sir, I've heard you can build anything"
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a Southern drawl
And a crooked smile, if you can
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy
There's an old Winchester rifle
Back home hangin' on the wall
He promised me he'd teach me how to aim
And he said when I got older
We could work on that curveball
I know he'd never wanna miss a game
So here's a little money that I've saved
Could you build me a daddy?
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a Southern drawl
And a crooked smile, if you can
I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make mama happy
If you could build me a daddy
Give him a big heart, make his arms wide open
I know he misses me, so Mister, I was hopin'
You could build me a daddy
Strong as Superman
Make him ten feet tall with a Southern drawl
And a fishing pole in his hand
'Cause I sure miss him
Maybe you could bring him back?
If I walked in with him, it'd sure make my mama happy
If you could you build me a daddy
Could you build me a daddy?

It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
Well I worked all week
So I could come here
Have a good time and an ice cold beer
But 1 turned to 10
And 10 turned to 20
And 20 plus an empty bottle's too damn many
It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
Well it seems that I, misplaced my shirt
I can't find my keys for all this parkin lot dirt
My fall back plan, has done got sad
Cause my ex-girlfriend aint lookin half bad
It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
Help me up
Aw put me back down, put me back down
I sucker punched my best friend
And the bouncer head locked me on stage with the band
I look like hell
I feel like shit
I think it's time I call it quits
It's time to take my drunk ass home
I drank all the whiskey and my moneys all gone
Hit on all the girls, sang every song
It's time to take my drunk ass home
Yea it's time to take my drunk ass home
I twisted up my ankle, can't find my cell phone
Yea my lips all busted and my buzz is gone
It's time to take my drunk ass home.
If yall agree, then sing along
Yeah, It's time to take, my drunk ass home

Ridin' down the road listenen' to the radio
You leaned over and you turned it up
You said "Baby this is it,
The one I wanted you to hear
Don't it sound just like us?"
Up 'til then, all I'd ever listened to 
Was a little sweet home, Tuesday's gone,
And workin' man blues
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you 
And everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Baby I'm not who I was
You gave me your love 
And it woke me up
Made me more aware 
Of somethin deep inside
Something that I have
A life I wanna share
And I'll remember this as long as I live
Every note, every word
Every single kiss
This is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you 
And everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song
Baby, this is my first love song
First time I felt the words
First time I sang along
Whenever it comes on
I just think of you 
And everything you do
You're my one, my from now on
My first love song

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Where are we goin' when we leave here? 
When the music's over and the bar runs out of beer 
If we stay too late, they're gonna kick us out
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where are we goin' when we leave here?
When the music's over and the bar runs out of beer
If we stay too late, they're gonna kick us out
Is it cool if I come crash at your house?
Where are we going? The night is young
And we're both half sober, hell-bent on having fun
You say if we hook up, there'll be no-strings attached
Save my number, you don't have to call me back
Let's have some cigarettes and find a spot that ain't closed yet
And if it is, we'll buy a box of wine
I just had to talk to you, forgive me if this comes out rude
You got to know it's true, but girl, you look so fine
Where are we going? If nowhere else
There's an old field road out past the shutdown Shell
We could shine those eyes, we could count them stars
Borrow some signs, go fishing in the dark
We'll sing some old Hank Jr. songs, "Outlaw Women" all night long
Make some good ol' down home memories
There's something 'bout the sky tonight, something 'bout your blue eyes
Baby, you remind me of my sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
My sweetest dream
Yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah
Where are we going? If this is love
There's no way to know but just between the two of us
It all feels so right with you in my arms
Where it's going, I don't know, but let's keep following our hearts
Ooh-ooh

Everything I learned about life
I learned out on that bank
From gettin' up early, comin' up empty
And good things come to those that wait
Money doesn't grow on trees
The difference in talking, and shootin' the breeze
I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude
And daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here?"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear
I grew up pretty lucky as far as lucky goes
Too broke for a boat
He coulda picked up an extra shift
Or a weekend at the factory
But every Sunday was saved for Jesus
And Saturdays, he spent with me
'Til that summer would fall
I didn't know we had it all
I remember thinkin', wouldn't it be cool
To have an old flat bottom and an Evinrude
And daddy saying, "Son, don't they bite just fine right here?"
He'd say, "Love what you got, buddy, not what you ain't
And just about then that bobber would sink
And that outboard dream of mine would disappear

Clean these old shades off

In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving

On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high
Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me
She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving

On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high
Come on!
She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the full moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine
She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving

Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly

It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was tryin' to talk to some other girl
And she was bird dogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled her over to the side
Brushed her hair back
And looked her straight in the eye
It was a spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
We gotta little drunk and had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby, bye bye, bye bye bye bye
Baby, bye bye, bye bye bye bye
No I don't need your number
Don't wanna be your facebook friend
I hate to break it to ya
But you won't ever see me again
If I'm a bad guy
Well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we gotta little drunk, we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up, baby bye bye
Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that ol' beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we gotta little drunk and had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
We gotta little drunk, and we had a good time

Lay a little bit of rubber down on some asphalt
You got line, better not get a butt call

Find a little spot down on the creek bank

And a tail light circle
Roll down the windows turn it on up
Pour a little Crown in a Dixie cup

Dancin' on the tailgate in the full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
If you aint a ten you're a nine point nine
Tippin' n' spillin' that home made wine
On your tied up T-shirt
Every little kiss is drivin' me wild
Thrown little cherry bombs into my fire
Good God all mighty
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Let's slip on out where it's a little bit darker
And when it gets a little bit hotter
We'll take it off all out in the water
Girl you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm mmmm
You're lookin' so good in what's left of those blue jeans
Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be
The best buzz I'm ever gonna find
Hey I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime
Yeah I'm a little drunk on you

TITLE: O Holy Night
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining 
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
Long lay the world in sin and error pining 
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night, when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, o holy night

TITLE: Faded Away
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I don't remember much about that time,
Just the smell of the air and your hand in mine
Riding the strip, sittin' on my lap
In the back of the truck with the only friends I had
It was spring break, we were out late,
And I though goodness for heavens sake
When I saw you
And then I kissed you
On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you, faded away
I still taste the shots on your lips that night,
And the smoke from the club still burns my eyes
Feel of your body takin' off your dress,
Waking up that morning in a tangled mess
So if I'da known, I'da held on
A little bit longer and stronger with nothing to lose,
'Cause I still see you
On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
We made love as the waves rolled in
And we owned that town for one weekend
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the sound of the boat
Starting up, heading out of the bay
Girl you, faded away
On a balcony over the sun
In a chair by the rail, high above everyone
I watched you drive through the gate
Without saying the words I needed to say
Like the tan on my skin, our names in the sand
Like the tears on your face
And the sun going down that day
Girl you, faded away
You faded away

TITLE: Like We Ain't Ever
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Late I buy stumble a few thousand beers in my day
You put down twice as many
No telling how many burn fires have lit up my face
If they ain't hundreds, it ain't many
I stood on this stage so many times
Being watched on my friends
Havin' the time of your life
There's somethin' in this Spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up bright
Like we ain't ever
All been together
Let's try to make one night last forever
Once you're sconed, you can't get it back
So leave a mark, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good rock we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever
This ain't the first time we've partied under the stars
Making a hung over
Well, this time I got a few more songs in this old guitar
For you to pull your baby closer
You pull your baby closer
Like we ain't ever
All been together
Let's try to make one night last forever
Once you're sconed, you can't get it back
So leave a mark, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good rock we don't know, know better
Like we ain't ever
Yeah, There's somethin' in this Spring time air tonight
And we're gonna do it up bright
Let's do it up bright
Like we ain't ever
All been together
Let's try to make one night last forever
Once you're sconed, you can't get it back
So leave a mark, y'all, where you at
Let's fill up on this feel good rock we don't know, know better

TITLE: Shake The Sand
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
From that first second I laid eyes on you
To them kisses this morning
To right now in this room
You know I’ve been going crazy over you
And here we are again tonight
Holding on feeling right
Lets shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
This can’t be no buzz from the salt in the air
I ain’t never had no drink do me like this I swear
Feels like I’m spinning around
Watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on feeling right
Before I hit the lights
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
So I’ll just keep holding on
Loving you all night long
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets

TITLE: Chuggin' Along
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Some days you got it all together
You swear you have it figured out
Other days you're stumbling and a wondering
What the hell it's all about
Life's kind of funny like that
Sometimes you're the dog sometimes you're the cat
All you can do is just keep going
And thank God for what you have
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your own song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good times in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along
Sometimes you get a bill in the mail
You don't know how you're gonna pay
Then your baby wraps her arms around you
And makes it all go away
Life's kinda funny like that
Sometimes you're the train sometimes you're the truck
And when that sun goes down
And there ain't no goin' back
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your own song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good times in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along
Keep chuggin' along
Keep singing your own song
Put the plow in the ground till the daylights gone
When you look back over your shoulder
At everything you've done
Put the good times in your pocket
Let the bad ones make you strong
Keep chuggin' along
Keep chuggin' along
Yea keep chuggin' along

TITLE: Down To One
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
We were countin' one star at a time
One fell out of the sky
You had your eyes closed, you were wishin' on 'em
I was thinkin' 'bout your lips, girl, and kissin' on 'em
We were sittin' in the light of the moon
I was watchin' it shine on you
Funny how time flies with a good girl
On a good night
We were down to 1 a.m.
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone, half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss, and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
Said we'd leave in one more minute
One passed by, but we didn't
'Cause you were looking like a dream I've been dreaming
I was thinking 'bout anything but leaving
Still feel that touch
You were in my arms
Soaking up that young love
Never been that far
Down to 1 a.m.
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone, half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss, and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one
I was saying, "Stay with me
I'll be everything you need"
We were way past 1 a.m.
Listenin' to one more song
Thinkin' I want more than just one night out here with you alone
Down to that last Bud Light
In the back of that two-tone, half-ton
My heart was tellin' me that one more kiss, and I'd be done
Down to one hand in mine
Down to one beautiful smile
I was done with the girl I want
Straight fallin' in love, right there that night
Down to one

It's five o'clock, so we're drinking again
Wearing flip flops, so we're drinking again
There's a jukebox, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
The suns out, so we're drinking again
Somebody bought a round, so we're drinking again
But we're all here and we got cold beer
And we're all drinking again
We'll be laughing and loving, high fiving and hugging
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again
The bartender's pretty so we're drinking again
Thinking kinda dirty so we're drinking again
It's past beer 30, so we're drinking again
We're all drinking again
Just got paid, so we're drinking again
Here comes the shot tray, so we're drinking again
Got a ride home and the bar ain't closed
So we're all drinking again
We'll be laughing and loving, high fiving and hugging
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again
Our team's playing, so we're drinking again
Cars are racing, so we're drinking again
I guess we're staying, so were drinking again
We're all drinking again
It's two for one, so were drinking again
It sure is fun, so were drinking again
The girls are friendly and this one's empty
So we're all drinking again
We'll be laughing and loving, high fiving and hugging
Pop top and long neck and honky tonk friends
We're all drinking again
Yeah, we're all drinking again
How 'bout another one? We're all drinking again
Nobody wants to leave
Somebody put it on my card
Declined? Alright, here's another
Alright
How'd we wind up here?
Who brought us here?
Same time, same place tomorrow!

TITLE: One Margarita
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Everybody here ain't from here
But we're here doin' our thing
Lettin' go a little, little by little
Sippin' on a frozen drink
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Buffett song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Marley song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
We'll be gone
Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, feelin' no pain
It goes like
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow
Leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey Señorita, don't you think we need
A salt and a Chesney song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita
We'll be gone
We'll be gone

Up
Early in the morning wakin' that sun
Up
Fillin' that coffee crankin' that tractor
Up
Prayin' it rains down on the devil's dust
Them rows come poppin'
Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up
Rollin' 'round town in a hand me down old pick
Up
Pullin' in the driveway pickin' that pretty thang
Up
Just layin' low where heaven and a dirt road touch
Holdin' a cold one
Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow
Up...
Up
On a Sunday pond bank tearin' that crank bait
Up
Livin' for a Friday, runnin' that scoreboard
Up
Keepin' that faith, waitin' on the day He calls us
Up
In the sky, there's a guy
Lookin' down on us
Lookin' up
Our whole life, raised up right
In a town nobody knows
What a way to grow

TITLE: Floatin' This Creek
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Put in this morning at first light
Had a biscuit on my way down
I was sittin' there waitin' on the first bite
From a rainbow or a brown
Anchor down at the bridge, gonna try a new midge
There was traffic flyin' by
Taillights glowin' red, thirty feet overhead
But it felt like a thousand miles
I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big, sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today
'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it on in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I've been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek
That rush hour traffic kinda slowed down
'Bout the time that the fish did too
Just me and this ol' green boat now
Nothin' but nothin' to do
So I broke out a cold one, called my buddies, told 'em
Slipped up and caught a state record
That's a little white lie, he was good eatin' size
But I like my story better
I'm just floatin' this creek and takin' it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today
'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I've been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Yeah, I'm just floatin' this creek
Put my boat back on the trailer, eased out on the blacktop
Kinda sucks but I gotta make a dollar
I'm feeling pretty good, so I won't bitch
'Cause in the morning when I'm diggin' that ditch
I'll be floatin' this creek and taking it slow
Tryin' to catch somethin' big and sip somethin' cold
I'd be a liar if I said I had a plan today
'Cept watch these banks roll by, take it all in
Don't get too deep, don't forget where I've been
Nothin' but time to see where it takes me
Floatin' this creek

Girl, I know I don't know you 
But your pretty little eyes so blue 
Are pulling me in like the moon on your skin 
I'm so glad you trusted me
Girl, I know I don't know you
But your pretty little eyes so blue
Are pulling me in like the moon on your skin
I'm so glad you trusted me
To slide up on this dusty seat
And let your hair down, and get outta town
Got the stars comin' out over my hood
And all I know now is it's goin' good
You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on
Or where we've been
From starin' at you, girl
All I know is I don't want this night to end
Gonna cuss the mornin' when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain't no good for me 'cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips, get drunk on your kiss
Clock on the dash says 3:35
There's plenty of gas and the night's still alive
You got your hands up
You're rockin' in my truck
You got the radio on
You're singin' every song
I'm set on cruise control
I'm slowly losin' hold
Of everything I've got
You're lookin' so damn hot
And I don't know what road we're on

Let it fade to black
Let me run my fingers down your back
Let's whisper, let's don't talk
Baby, leave my t-shirt in the hall
Like a needle finds a groove
Baby, we'll remember what to do
To drown out every distraction
It's time we made it happen
Strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
I wanna drop this cell phone now
And let it shatter on the ground
They ain't holdin' nothin' these two hands
Until they're holding you again
Oh, strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans
We both know that we lost it somehow
Let's get it found
Strip it down, down, down
Strip it down, down, down
I don't wanna let you go
No, not tonight
I just wanna love you so bad, baby
So let's close our eyes
And strip it down, strip it down
Back to you and me like it used to be
When it was an old back road with an old school beat
Cowboy boots by your little bare feet
Let it out, tell me right now
Everything I need in them white cotton sheets
Dirty dance me slow in the summertime heat
Feel my belt turn loose from these old blue jeans

We've been gettin' beat up by this ol' life,
Seems all we got left is Friday and Saturday night 
And sometimes Sunday if Monday is a holiday.
I got a bunch of buddies I ain't seen in a while,
I got some good-time fun and hot dog buns in a stock pile, 
With some home brew, Malibu and Miller Lite.
Girl put on that short little party dress and make me a little bit jealous. 
It's gonna be a wild weekend,
Been on the phone with all my friends.
There's a little spot in the river bend
Were the sun sits high.
Long as the keg don't float and the ice don't melt, 
We'll loosen up a notch on the Bible belt.
Girl you can bet we'll fall in love again and again and again.
It's gonna be a wild, wild, wild weekend.
It's Friday afternoon and the countdowns on, 
Cell phone's singin' that All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight,
Bad to the bone rington, 
Come on, come on, come on, baby let's get gone.
It's bumper to bumper in the outbound,
And we're already gettin' down.
It's gonna be a wild weekend,
Been on the phone with all my friends.
There's a little spot in the river bend 
Were the sun sits high.

It's just a regular Saturday night in the summer
Same guys and girls and the same stars way up in the sky
It's like the music stopped playing when I saw your body
Did you come here with someone or come here to party tonight?
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Anywhere you gotta be?
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl?
My out of nowhere girl
Girl are you lost? Are you just here in town for the weekend?
All of my life I've been here, never seen you before
If you need someone to show you around, girl I got you
I gotta know you and hold you
I don't wanna leave here alone anymore
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?
Anywhere you gotta be?
Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl?
I just wanna talk to you
Tell me what you wanna do
Yeah we gotta go somewhere
My little out of nowhere girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We could go anywhere you want
Baby I got you
You know I got you
When you walked in this place, you turned it up
Right when I saw you
Baby I saw you
My little light out of nowhere girl
Where you been all my life?
Where you been trying to hide?
It's like you come
Come from another world
Fell right out of the sky
And landed right here tonight
Do you wanna dance with me?

Do you wanna go somewhere my little out of nowhere girl?

TITLE: Knockin' Boots
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane
This radio needs three songs to play
To get me across town to you
That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down
Friday nights need to do
What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishing in the dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirring
Small town nights need both ends burning
Shades need drawing, hearts need falling
Boots need knockin'
Knockin' boots
Knockin' boots
Me and you
Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slinging
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you want me tonight
Sing-a-longs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls needa call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad
Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishing in the dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirring
Small town nights need both ends burning
Shades need drawing, hearts need falling
Boots need knockin'
Knockin' boots
Knockin' boots
Girl me and you
Doors need shutting
Lights need cutting
Lips need locking
Boots need knockin'
And birds need bees and ice needs whiskey
Boys like me need the girls like you to kiss me
Fishing in the dark needs Nitty Gritty
Under that pale moon
Sweet tea needs that sugar stirring
Small town nights need both ends burnin'
Shades need drawing, hearts need falling
Boots need knockin'
Knockin' boots
Mmm, knockin' boots
Me and you, oh
Knockin' boots

TITLE: Hooked On It
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
First time I tied a plastic worm on and felt him on the other end
It was get the net, get him in the boat
Yeah buddy, I was hooked on it
First time I heard Chattahoochee on the speakers of my radio
I was topping off the tank on my old tune tone it
I was hooked on it
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
The first time I got that Gulf Coast white sugar sand on my feet
Saw the sunshine dancing on that clear blue water
I was hooked on it
First time I pulled me a long neck bottle from the bottom of a bucket of ice
As soon as that cold beer hit my lips 
I was hooked on it
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life runs through my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Come on
Like a Friday payday honky tonk buzz
I gotta have a little more of it just because
I keep coming back to the good stuff, 'cause I'm hooked on it
So many things where I grew up
Once you get a little, you can't get enough
This small town life's all in my blood
And I'm hooked on it
Yeah, I'm hooked on it
I'm hooked on it

TITLE: Chevrolet
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I'm gonna find a way to love again 
I'm on the winnin' stretch of a losin' end 
Foot on the gas, I'm freedom bound 
I've got the morning sun at my back, and I'm inspired
I'm gonna find a way to love again
I'm on the winnin' stretch of a losin' end
Foot on the gas, I'm freedom bound
I've got the morning sun at my back, and I'm inspired
Nothing can slow me down
She used to get me.
I was held back by her memory.
Let the highway sing
A song of a new beginning, keep these wheels a spinnin'.
Gonna hammer down
While the distant sky is wakin', light behind me's breakin.
I found a better way, in the form of a Chevrolet.
A strange reminder of how I walked a step behind her
Back here in the shadows of an 18-wheeler
Where I'm headin I still don't know
But I caught the wind of an AM station
Blarin on my radio.
I ain't lookin back.
I never though I could say that. So

ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Roll in the bar, me and my crew
Their little plan to get me over you
They're hookin' me up, yeah
Buyin' me drinks with a thousand girls
There's just one thing
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head in the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you
Don't know what you did, but you done it good
You don't know how bad that I wish I could
Delete you from my phone, find you girl and take you home
But there's just one thing wrong
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head
In the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon
Baby, I see you
Your lips, your eyes
Girl, since you told me goodbye
I can't go anywhere, I can't do anything
No, I can't close my eyes without you in my dreams
You won't leave me alone, even though I know you're gone
I look around for someone new, but I see you
Jumpin' up there with the band
Takin' me by the hand
Hey boy, come dance with me
Stuck like a melody in my head in the bed of my truck
By the light of the midnight moon

LYRICS:
I'm not supposed to wanna love you no more
No more cards and flowers, no more knocks on your door
Just forget the perfect love that we had, but I don't know if I can do that
I was so certain baby you were the one, that this was it and all my searchin' was done
I should admit you're gone, get used to the facts
But I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that
I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't know
The things I'm feelin' they just won't go away
I see you out and I don't know what to say
My friends all tell me that I oughta be glad
But I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that
I don't know how I'll ever let you go
Since you walked out, there's so much I don't
So much I don't know
Someday, somebody will really love me
And she'll be everything I thought you would be
And all I wanna do is love her back
But I don't know if I can do that, I don't know if I can do that

ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
You know the one where you call
But you act like you never called me
When you see me at a bar
But you act like you never saw me
When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me
Or I'm holding her, and I'm hoping you see
Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me
All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party
The way you make sure it gets back to me
That you got with somebody
The way you wake up, say it was just a mistake
But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that
All of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah
I can't tell if I'm winning or losing
Somebody tell me what are we doing
Nobody ever comes out on top
Tell me are we ever gonna stop
Playing these games
This break-up, make-up, hot and cold thing got me dizzy
You don't want me til I got somebody with me
It's gonna kill me
Baby tell me,
What am I supposed to do with you
And all of these games, we play
I can't even keep 'em all straight
Do we mean what we say
We got lines crossed all over the place, yeah

High beams you and me 
Little back road barely see 
Right song radio 
Through it in low and drive slow

Little back road barely see
Right song radio
Through it in low and drive slow
I saw you and it lit me up
A girl like you is just to much
Kill the lights!
Kill the lights!
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride!
Take me high!
Yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin don't care where we been, pull me in and kill the lights
We can feel our way through
Let me just hold onto you
Baby trust my hands
Live it up while we still can and
Kill the lights!
Kill the lights!
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry
Feel the ride!
Take me high!
Yellow moon in your eyes
Lost in your slow stare
In the middle of nowhere
Skin on skin don't care where we been, pull me in and kill the lights
Don't it feel right, until the sun rise
We can just go on what we know
Can't help but wanna watch you
You wanna do this don't you
Come here let me pull you closer
You reach over
And kill the lights!
Kill the lights!
You can take me there tonight
We can make some sparks fly
We can make the dark cry

It's like a bolt of lightning hits me in my chest
Right out of the blue
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Top of the world I'm standing rocking at my best
Then I look like a fool
Every time I see you, every time I see you
You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like an early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
I wanna tell you everything I ever wanted to say
But I never do
Every time I see you, every time I see you
I'm sure my steering wheel and dashboard
Would love a good break but they feel it too
Every time I see you, why I gotta see you?
You're like a wreck out on the highway
I can't look away and I can't pass through
You're like a early morning Monday
Bringing me down, messing with my mood
I'd love to say I can hold myself together
But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you, yeah
Oh, you're like a wreck out on the highway

Bringing me down, messing with my mood

But I can't help but come unglued
Every time I see you, every time I see you
Every time I see you, oh yeah
Oh, I'm walking down the street
And you walk right up to me and I freeze
Every time I see you

TITLE: Suntan City
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down
Speakers where a bumpin',
Little hip-hop somethin'
I was stirrin' up a coke and crown
Didn't even check in the room,
We went straight for the beach,
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt
Now I'm scoutin' my spot,
Where we were gunna rock,
With the biggest buzz I ever felt
Now I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls
They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, Im sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
(Whoooo!)
Hey there cutie with a Kentuky coozie,
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends,
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?
Yea I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls
They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, Im sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
I gotta buddy who blew all his money,
And he had to stay his broke-ass home,
He's been goin' crazy, blowin' up my phone
Wantin' to know whats goin' on
I tell him Im sittin pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls
And they keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, Im sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
(Yeah!)
Sittin' pretty, right here in Suntan City

Of all the bars you could've walked your boots into
Why'd it have to be the one that I picked too?
I just wanted a place to sip my way through missin' you
You didn't see me when you walked past me
I wasn't ready to see you this happy
Looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine (a little less broken than mine)
To hell with killin' what's left of this Walker Black
'Cause I ain't lettin' you know that I hurt this bad
I'll just hang my head underneath this hat, and slip out the back
I'm dealin' with not being together
So are you but you're doin' it better
It looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it took you just a little less time
Looks like your heart's just a little less broken than mine
Maybe goodbye didn't hit you the way that it hit me
Guess hearts don't ever break fifty-fifty
Oh, 'cause it looks like I'm movin' just a little less on with this
Looks like your world has got a little less wrong with it
Looks like it's takin' me a little more time
'Cause baby, your heart's just a little less broken, a little less broken than mine
A little less broken than mine (a little less broken than mine)

TITLE: Pick It Up
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I put a fishing rod by your bed
Right next to a Bible
I leaned a guitar in the corner of your room
With some Milsap on vinyl
I figured the best thing I could do 
Was put a thing or two
And that it wouldn't hurt to have in your way, on your path
Hoping you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it to you
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
You just pick it up, pick it up
Early to rise, headin' to work
Open a door for a stranger
Yes sir, yes madam, red dirt on my hands
Showing you the best way I can
So you might pick it up one day
And you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it to you
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you
But I didn't never try to make you pick it up
Yeah, you just pick it up
Dancing and kissing your Mama in the kitchen
Treatin' her like a princess, hoping you might pick it up one day
Hoping you might learn a couple pretty cool things
That I love to do
Then you can take it and spin it, and fit it to you
I don't know what you gonna be
But I hope you smile when you think of me
'Cause I helped make you

Find me a place in the sand
Clean these old shades off
Damn, y'all don't understand
All she wants to do is dance
She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Clouds roll by
She get me high
Don't nobody block my view
Hell you can find a spot and watch too
Watch how she makes this beach
Light up like the sky on New Year's Eve
Love it when she's locked on me
She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, or in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high
Come on!
She said, "Boy, it's time to take me home"
Don't even grab your stuff
Just lay me on down
Need the full moonshine
You 'bout to be all mine
She get me high
She get me low
She got the key to this old bronco
In her bare feet, in her high heels
No matter how she moving
It's all the same thrill
On top of my Yeti
On an old boat dock
Standing in the river on an old flint rock
Watch me fly
She get me high
Clouds roll by

Playing out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer

I remember when we started this week long party
And to think that it's over

And I wish it could last forever and ever
Ohh but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
And just thinking bout how

Wishing I was down there with ya hanging out

TITLE: We Rode In Trucks
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Down where I was born was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
We raised cotton, corn, a little cane, and kids
You either lived on a farm or wish you did
Jesus always walked close by our side
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
There's a lot about life we learned on the bus,
How to lie, how to fight, how to kiss, how to cuss
The closer we sat to the back, the smarter we got
We were poor, we were ugly, we were all best friends
White-eyed, baptized, and still wantin' to sin
Thank God we get more than just one shot
Where I grew up, we rode in trucks
That's us, haulin' hay in the field with the radio on
That's us, headin' straight into town when the work is done
In my mind, I can still see us now, 
Ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago
We thought tobacco and beer in a can
Was all it would take to be like our old man
But I saw how it made my momma cry
It was huntin' and fishin' and football games
Then it was girls, and everything changed
Fallin' in and out of love, we rode in trucks
That's us with our tailgates down in the parking lot
That's us with mud on our tires when it rained a lot
In my mind, I can still see us now 
Ridin' down Buck Island Road
It wasn't that long ago 
It's apart of my soul, yeah
It's apart of my soul
Down where I was born, it was heaven on earth
The Flint River washes that red Georgia dirt
The sun sets slow and the stars shine bright
Where I grew up 
We rode in trucks

LYRICS:
You know I got me a spot somewhere
Come on
There's a little place down the old road
Nobody but me and the whole world knows
Been going there ever since I was a kid
On my red dirt bike, and my blue Texan
Spend a lot long summer nights
With the hood out in the satellites
Ain't the kind of place that I ever shared
But come on with me, and let me take you where
I do my barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
And when the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there
There's a big oak on the other side
Where I took my grandpa's pocket knife
And I carved their names with tears in my eyes
When we join grandma, and the by and by
Got them right here in the dashboard box
Tip broke off and the blade don't lock
But I'd better carve our names just fine
If you wanna come along with me next time
I do my barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the man in the sky
Baby, jump on in
There's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
And with the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there
Yeah, I done some barber sinking
Peanut butter sandwich eatin'
Watching the world go by
Where I've done some beer crackin'
Crying, praying, laughin'
Just talking to the big man in the sky
Baby, jump on in, there's a huckleberry limb
We can leave our cut offs and our cares
Who knows what can happen
With the summer's sweet jasmine in the air
I do all my dreamin' there
Right there, ha ha ha

TITLE: The Car In Front Of Me
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Homecoming parade 
You were the queen
I was riding right behind you
With the rest of the team
Saw my ring on your finger 
As you waved to the crowd
I didn't know a second stringer 
Could ever be so proud
The car in front of me was carrying 
What I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream 
Was in the car in front of me
On Wednesday nights 
We'd meet at church
You'd bring the kids 
And I'd come straight from work
Going home I'd read their lips 
Through the window of your van
As they sang Jesus loves me 
I thought God I'm a lucky man
The car in front of me was carrying 
What I loved more than anything
My sweetest dream 
Was in the car in front of me
Even after what the doctor said
You were strong and you believed
And you held us all together 
Through one more spring
Their little hands held on to mine
As we sat in that backseat 
With tears in our eyes
A long line of headlights
Strangers stopped along the road
No Monday wasn't meant 
For wearing Sunday clothes
The car in front of me was carrying 
What I loved more than anything
Oh, my sweetest dream 
Was in the car in front of me

LYRICS:
Real sad story here y'all
Come on
I pulled her into my right
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning up my credit card
She was burning tires out in the parking lot
I think I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
Oh well, looks like I've done it again
I ran another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here in Panama City
Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag along
Whatever y'all need, yeah, it's on me
So here's to me doing whatever the hell I want
'Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Ya'll drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need
'Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand I brought to the beach

The ones that like to dance
The ones that like to drink
Every homegrown ten
Downhome pretty
Holla on back
Hit me with your twenty
Where they're swinging them jeans
To a hillbilly track
Put me smack dab
In the middle of that
Drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at?
Where's my Alabama red?
Where's my Tennessee wild?
Talking Tallahassee legs, huh
I need a Georgia peach smile
New York City, California coast
Somebody let a brother know
Where the country girls at?
Where they gon' be?
The ones that like to dance
Ones that like to drink
Every homegrown ten
Downhome pretty
Holla on back
Hit me with your twenty
Where they're swinging them jeans
To a hillbilly track
Put me smack dab
In the middle of that
Drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at?
Oh where are you, baby? (hey ho)
Yeah I'm talkin'
Parking lot, dive bar
Keg party, old barn
All I know is I wanna go
(Hit 'em, Pitbull)
I'm at the NASCAR epicenter Daytona 500
Grand marshal track house representor 
White cones at the stage, I'm in the suite
Next to the greatest of all time, baby, MJ (twenty-three)
Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, show me love
Trace Adkins, Pitbull, Luke Bryan, throw 'em up
Now where my country girls at? With their Daisy Daisy Dukes
Cowboy boots and their cowboys hats, I said
Where my country girls at? With their Daisy Daisy Dukes
Cowboy boots and their cowboys hats
Where the country girls at?
Where they gon' be?
The ones that like to dance
Ones that like to drink
Every homegrown ten
Downhome pretty
Holla on back
Hit me with your twenty
Where they're swinging them jeans
To a hillbilly track
Put me smack dab

Drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast

Well, drop a pin on the map
Get me there fast
Where the country girls at?
Lord, where the country girls at?
(Where my country girls at?)
Where the country girls at?

Got a little brother low
The ones that like to hunt
The ones that like to fish (mmhm)
The ones that like to shake it to a song like this 
Yeah, where the country girls at?
(Hey hey hey hey)
(Where they at?)

TITLE: If You Ain't Here To Party
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
We got beer, and a tub,
And some good lookin' girls
Dressed to the nights,
Lookin' for a good time
Jacked up trucks, stacked in thick
White rocks stuck, in the mud grips
And a big 'ole bouncer at the door
But don't show him your I.D.
And don't you dare step out on the floor
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And head your ass back home
If you ain't here to party
There's a little 'ole Louisiana band
Playin' a swampy jam and brown sugar tans
Lookin' so fine shakin' that thang
In the zydeco cage and purple rain
Raise your drink up in the air
And everybody sing along
Man, you're here all alone
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and throw your card down
Knock a shot out
And get yourself in the zone
Yeah, you might as well go on
And carry your ass back home
If you ain't here to party
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong place
You picked the wrong Friday night
If you ain't here to party
You'll be missin' out on the
Best damn time of your life
So go on and pick someone out
Maybe make out
And get their number in your phone
Man, the only way that you'll be
Goin' home alone is
If you ain't here to party
Yeah, you better be here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Yeah, we're all here to party
Throw your keys on the bar
You ain't drivin' your car
You're here with me
That's how it's gonna be
'Cause we're here to party, baby
Yeah, yeah whoa
If you ain't here to party
You picked the wrong Friday night

LYRICS:
Uh, uh
I got that real good, feel good stuff
Up under the seat of my big black jacked up truck
Rollin' on thirty-fives
Pretty girl by my side
You got that sun tan skirt and boots
Waitin' on you to look my way and scoot
Your little hot self over here
Girl, hand me another beer, yeah
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River
Catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
Might sit down on my diamond plate tailgate
Put in my country-rock hip-hop mixtape
Little Conway, a little T-Pain
Might just make it rain (make it rain)
You can hang your T-shirt on a limb
Hit that bank and we can ease on in
Soak us up a little moonlight
You know I know what you like, yeah
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River
Catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner
When I lay you down and love you right
Yeah, that's my kind of night
Yeah, that's my kind of night
(Oh)
My kind or your kind, it's this kind of night
We dance in the dark and your lips land on mine
Oh, gonna get our love on
Oh, time to get our buzz on
All them other boys wanna wine you up and take you downtown
But you look like the kind that likes to take it way out
Out where the corn rows grow, row, row my boat
Floatin' down the Flint River
Catch us up a little catfish dinner
Gonna sound like a winner

LYRICS:
T-shirt, blue jeans, don't like much on TV 
Caviar and a Triscuit, ain't no red eye gravy on a biscuit 
My deep southern drawl makes the conversation crawl 
You're gonna have to hang around long enough to hear me out
T-shirt, blue jeans, don't like much on TV
Caviar and a Triscuit, ain't no red eye gravy on a biscuit
My deep southern drawl makes the conversation crawl
You're gonna have to hang around long enough to hear me out
Some folks ain't happy like they are
Some wanna take things just a little too far
Singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires wanna ride old farm tractors
I am just what I am, I'm just what you see
So I'll make it easy, I'll stay me
My granny and papa, still missing hee haw
And I love my little town where the people don't let you down
There's a girl down the street, got a kiss just waitin' on me
Hot dogs, sweet potato fry, when I go over tonight
She knows exactly who I am
A soft touchin', her love loving hard working man
Quarterbacks wanna play lead guitar
And super models want smaller body parts
Change is good sometimes, but I still believe
I'm gonna make it easy, I'll stay me
Yeah, singers wanna be Hollywood actors
And millionaires want to ride old farm tractors
And I am just what I am, I'm just what you see
So, I'll make it easy, I'll stay me

My clothes thrown everywhere
Woke up in my rocking chair
Holding a beer in my hand
Sporting a neon tan
My stereo cranked up
I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club?
Ain't got a clue what went down
So I started calling around
And all my friends say
I started shooting doubles
When you walked in
All my friends say
I went a little crazy
Seeing you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raising some cane
I was a rock star, party hard
Getting over you, comeback kid
Yeah, I must have did
What all my friends say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I found my billfold
I cried oh, no, no
Good time Charlie got me, now I'm broke
But it was worth acting like a fool

LYRICS:
Your daddy had a lakehouse
He had me paint it that summer sophomore year
Said I could stay for free
A couple buddies, a couple weeks
You rode in in a little red Honda
And headed straight for the pier
Tank top and cutoff jeans
A little back sun underneath
Who knew it was 'bout to be
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashin' into me
Nothin' will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, ayy
I turned those shutters the color of your eyes
'Til the day turned into night
And took turns with a jar
Turned that boat dock into a bar
And then we passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
But we felt like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashin' into me
Nothin' will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Yeah
We set July on fire
(Whoa ooo ooa)
Yeah, girl, you and I were

Tequila makes me loco, champagne hurts my head
But let me tell ya I'm a real big fan, of ice fishin' for them aluminum cans

Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll

king of the grill and a short putt sinker
I'm just a cold beer drinker
Monday through 5 o' clock Friday I'm a hard workin' man
Responsible, kinda dull, head-down, stick to the plan
But all my buddies know me better than that,
Get us all together and we start throwing 'em back

Got a cooler in the back with a 12 pack ready to roll

TITLE: I Knew You That Way
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
The secret way long shadows bleed into the night.
The desperate way leaves in the fall hold colors tight.
The way that thunder knows the taste of summer rain.
I knew you that way.
The way cool mountain waters, dance down to the sea.
Mound by something strong, but still so wild and free.
It gives into the passion of the path it takes.
I knew you that way.
I held you closer than I had a right to hold.
But the only thing that time can't take away, is I knew you that way.
The way that skin on skin can start a crazy fire.
That no one sees but burns all night with desire.
The quiet ease that makes a lover wanna stay.
I knew you that way.
I held you closer than I had a right to hold.
But the only thing that time can't take away, is I knew you that way.
The holy way that love knows that it should never end.
The sacred way that stars got sailors home again.
Like teardrops know the words to Amazing Grace.
I knew you that way.
I knew you that way.
I knew you that way.

TITLE: Harvest Time
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
There's peanut dust and corn husks driftin' through the air tonight
The marchin' band's warmin' up under the football lights
There's tractor-trailers backed up down by the elevator
Train track grain car will roll in later
Get filled up and head on out in the world
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
There's a thermos and a water jug rollin' around in the cab
A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a greasy red rag
Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringin' us supper
We grab a bite and make sure to hug her
Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time
At a quarter 'til 2 I kick off my boots in the laundry room
We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon
'Til it's all done until we're all done
It's harvest time in this little town
Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down
Fill our diesel tank up, make another round
There's a big red moon comin' up in the sky
Combine's cuttin' in a staggered line
The only time of year we miss the church bells chime
It's harvest time

That's the kind of boys that you want on your home team

Yeah, you think you're gonna catch your big dreams just like that
Fast
And here you are, looking back
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man
It just goes too fast
Fast
That's what your parents said when we were falling in love
It's too fast
There ain't no way the two of us were ever going to last
But we did, and here we are, and our only problem is
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry
And all you keep trying to do is slow it down, soak it in
Keep trying to make the good times last as long as you can
But you can't, man

Looking at you looking out the window right now
Those eyes, that dress, that smile, that laugh
If I could hit pause I would somehow
But it don't work like that
Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes
Sand through the glass sure falls in a hurry

Since I met her last night
Some kinda burnin' breakfast 
Lost at work state of mind
We're meeting here because
She mentioned that she loves
This kinda sushi, veggie 
Raw and edgy natural stuff
But I'm feelin' out of place 
But baby's on the way
I'm just boots and a rusty Chevy 
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey baby's on the way
Ain't gonna try those lines
Been used so many times
Like "When you fell from heaven, 
Did it hurt and did you cry?"
I'm just gonna wear this smile
Sit back and talk a while
Pull a few questions from my 
"Get to know her better" file
Hey, it's a real good day 
'Cause baby's on the way
I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy 
My hands are sweatin' heavy
Something she's got got me feelin' like this
All I gotta do is play it cool
And end the night with a kiss
Hey, hey baby's on the way
Oh, yeah, yeah
It's just a simple case of can't wait
Gonna be great to see her again
Gonna be tough to hide what's inside 
And in my eyes when she walks in
Oh, I'm just boots in a rusty Chevy
My hands are sweating heavy
Something she's got got me feeling like this

You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I take another chance
Take a shot, take a fall for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new
I loved you with the fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you said
Sorry like the angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
That it's too late to apologize
It's too late
I said it's too late to apologize

Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet
It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Lookin' good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco
I flipped it over up on Arnot Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot
No it ain't hard to pick me out
'Cause it's the only one in this town
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Lookin' good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco
Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Lookin' good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still tear up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go

Gonna cuss the mornin' when it comes
'Cause I know that the risin' sun
Ain't no good for me 'cause you'll have to leave
Gonna make the most of every mile
Do anything to make your smile
Land on my lips, get drunk on your kiss

Seventeen, we owned those streets
Parking lot, that was our spot
That's where we'd always meet
And we'd roll on out in a pickup truck parade
Stake our claim with a fire in a field in the middle of Nowhere, USA
We'd light the midnight up
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go 'round
Nothin' but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
All the girls next door
They'd meet us out there
They couldn't wait to get away
And come and let down their hair
We were rough around the edges
They were sweet as they could be
They were way too good
But they still let us steal a little kiss before they'd leave
Guess they thought we were cool because
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
Yeah, we thought we made the world go 'round
Drop it down in four-wheel
Set up on a big hill
And make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
From crazy kids to dirt road kings
Oh, we didn't know nothin'
But we knew everything
We'd drive too fast
We'd get too loud
We thought we made the world go 'round
Nothin' but a bunch of time to kill
Set up on the big hill
Make a toast, drink it down
Say, yeah man, we run this town
High five and look around
Damn right, we run this town
Man, I love this town

And I wanna get to know you
Better than I know this little town, yes I do

Parked out in the middle of nowhere
There's a place I can get up against your lips
That's where I gotta be with you lookin' like this
Let's get lost somewhere 
Anywhere we ain't gotta hold back 
If we're gonna go out, baby 
Let's go out like that
And I'll grab your door 
You can take my hand 
Hop up on my shoulders and I'll walk us over 
Where we can dance
And I'll leave the headlights on
So, I can see your face
Spin you 'round in the mud
Yeah, soak it all up, baby
What'cha say, what'cha say

Take a sip, leave a tip, get to throwing them back.
Nothing but a few beers, on my mind.
Then the door swings open, I looked left.
You in that red dress, dagger through my chest.
There goes my good time
Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
It'd just make it worse, if you knew it hurt
And seen me sneaking out the backdoor now.
Looks like I'll be hanging around.
I try not to stare, or wonder if you care.
Hell, I don't even know if you know I'm here.
Or that I'm dodging you through the crowd.
Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
Maybe one in the back with the sear torn,
Where the smokes so thick you can't even see the dancefloor.
Cause, I know you're on the dancefloor baby.
Where's a corner booth, when I need one?
A little spot I can hide, where the neon
Don't hit me, making it easy for everyone to know you ain't here with me.
All I want to find me is a waitress, to pour me up a shot of, forget this.
Damn night, and everything we've ever done.
I just wanna forget everything we done.
Where's a corner booth when I need one?
When I need one.

Runnin' kind of late, got her makeup half on 
Touch it up good enough

TITLE: Light It Up
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It don't leave my sight since we had that fight
Can't remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it
I get so neurotic about it baby
'Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you're looking for my love
Then light it up
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick 'I miss you' pictures
I'm on your clock, you're in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers
I get so neurotic about it baby
'Cause I know you're reading your phone
I can't help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you're looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up
I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it, I feel the buzz in my bed
And I don't get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if you're looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it up

TITLE: Do I
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Baby, what are we becomin'?
It feels just like we're always runnin'
Rollin' through the motions everyday
I could lean in to hold you or act like I don't even know you
Seems like you could care less either way
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby?
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?
Remember when we didn't have nothin'
But a perfect simple kind of lovin'?
Baby, those sure were the days
There was a time our love ran wild and free
But now, I'm second guessin' everything I see
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I
Still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep, baby, do I?
Whoa
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you, baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love? Am I still enough?
Tell me don't I? Or tell me, do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Tell me, baby do I get one more try?
Do I? Baby, do I?

LYRICS:
From that first second I laid eyes on you
To them kisses this morning
To right now in this room
You know I’ve been going crazy over you
And here we are again tonight
Holding on feeling right
Lets shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
This can’t be no buzz from the salt in the air
I ain’t never had no drink do me like this I swear
Feels like I’m spinning around
Watching the wind through your hair
And here we are again tonight
Holding on feeling right
Before I hit the lights
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
So I’ll just keep holding on
Loving you all night long
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
Take them shoes off your feet
Slide the door on open
Listen to the waves on the beach
Pull you in like the tides
Get lost in your eyes, oh girl
Before you get to loving on me
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets
Let’s shake the sand off the sheets

TITLE: The Sand I Brought To The Beach
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Real sad story here y'all
Come on
I pulled her into my right
And we rode down here
Maybe some sun, maybe some quality time
We've had a rocky year
She wasn't ready for me jumping on the bar
And buying everybody them shots
While I was burning up my credit card
She was burning tires out in the parking lot
I think I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Somebody drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
Oh well, looks like I've done it again
I ran another one off
Maybe I'm better off a single man
At least down here in Panama City
Now that I'm free for the rest of the week
Feel free to tag along
Whatever y'all need, yeah, it's on me
So here's to me doing whatever the hell I want
'Cause I just lost the sand that I brought to the beach
I guess she didn't like the Spring Break side of me
Now I'm rolling with my boys for the rest of the week
Ya'll drink one with me
Oh, 'cause I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I just lost the sand I brought to the beach
I guess I can't control the Spring Break side of me
A ride home from my boys now is all I need
'Cause I just lost the sand I brought to the
Yeah I lost the sand I brought to the
Yes I've lost the sand I brought to the beach

It was bumper to bumper when I hit that county
So I stopped and let the top down
Speakers where a bumpin',
Little hip-hop somethin'
I was stirrin' up a coke and crown
Didn't even check in the room,
We went straight for the beach,
Didn't even give the ice a chance to melt
Now I'm scoutin' my spot,
Where we were gunna rock,
With the biggest buzz I ever felt
Now I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls
They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, Im sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
(Whoooo!)
Hey there cutie with a Kentuky coozie,
Have you ever hung with a Georgia boy?
And why don't you and your friends,
Ease on over here and chug a beer with Miss Illinois?
Yea I'm sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
Got the best view in the world,
Spendin' my days catchin' these rays,
Watchin coconut covered girls
They keep strollin' by,
And they keep rollin' in,
Like the waves on the sand
Yea, Im sittin' pretty in Suntan City,
With a cold one in my hand
I gotta buddy who blew all his money,
And he had to stay his broke-ass home,
He's been goin' crazy, blowin' up my phone
Wantin' to know whats goin' on

Watchin coconut covered girls

I'm gonna put on my new shirt
Shine up these old boots
Take a deep breath
Try to keep my cool
I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna have a couple drinks, just to knock off the edge
Not too much, don't wanna make a fool of myself
I know you're gonna be there, I know you're gonna be there
And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care
I know you're gonna be there
You love the band that's playing, you wouldn't miss them for the world
All our friends are coming out and if I know one thing, girl,
I know you're gonna be there
Gonna walk right by that table where you always like to sit
And when I run into you, it's gonna be an accident
I know you're gonna be there
I'm gonna act like it ain't nothing, but another Friday night
And you're just some old friend and I'm doing just fine
Like I'm only going out to shake off another week
Maybe see the boys and catch a buzz somewhere
But I know you're gonna be there
And I'm gonna bring somebody I barely even know
And when you turn my way, I'm gonna pull her in real close
And the crazy thing about it is I ain't into her at all
I just wanna see if you still care

TITLE: Move
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Your mama packed y'all up and moved you to the south
Packed a U-Haul cross a one-tree yard to a tin roof shotgun house
You didn't know nobody, didn't talk too much
Had a rocking little body with a yankee strut
A little shy side, a little wild side
With your long blonde hair all pulled up
Then you got in with some southern belles
Cut your jeans off with a rebel yell
Learned the talk of the Bible belt
Now, girl, I melt when you
M-O-V-E, I love it yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live old Moonlyn
When that song hits
Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move
It's like there's something in the air
That turns you wild when a country song
Is way up loud and the sun goes down
Right about then, you lock eyes on me
You got me where you want me, where I wanna be
All up in the middle of your left and right
Just side to side, yeah, you're right on time when you
M-O-V-E, I love it yeah, I love it when you get that deed
Boots on, stomp your feet
It's like you've been waiting on me to
Move like you do
All sexy and smooth
Like you love to
Oh, girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live old Moonlyn
When that song hits
Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice
DJ plays that throwback tune
But I can't move when you move
Let me talk to you
M-O-V-E
I love it when you, love it when you feel the beat
C-O-M-E
Come on, I wanna see you
Move like you do
sexy and smooth
Like you love to
girl, look at you
Legs and your hips
Live old Moonlyn
When that song hits
Damn, you turnin' loose
Stars of the southern sky
Buzz of the fire and ice

You don't know what you do
You don't know how bad you turn me on
You don't know what it does
You don't know how you don't do no wrong
You got me wrapped around your little finger
Oh, good lookin' girl
That little dimple when you smile might as well be a hook in my heart
It's so simple how I feel
I gotta just be wherever you are
Every time I pick you up
It's like you start
Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
I swear I'm about to lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes
Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night
I can't help but tell myself, oh boy you got it so damn good
Oh, good lookin' girl
You don't have to say a thing
Just sit there and let me sing to you
Let the sun lit down, and the moon come around and just move ya
And let me just get lost in how good looking girl
You can be when you don't even mean to be because it's so natural
With your hair pulled up and my hat girl you know I can't handle
Some things I just can't handle
'Cause you start
Rocking me, rocking me, when you roll with me
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby

Love on me, love on me, in the middle of a long night

Good morning good looking girl
I ain't never felt nothing quite like when you're
Rocking me, rocking me, gotta roll with it
Ain't no stopping me, stopping me
Gotta go with it baby
You're so damn fine, and you're on my mind
And I'm gon' lose it
When you look at me, look at me with those big pretty blue eyes

TITLE: Shore Thing
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
There's a fifty-fifty chance
That the room ain't ready
Odds are, the cooler's too heavy,
To tote down to the beach all by myself
I'd be willing to bet,
By the end of the week
I'll pass out in room 319
And to round up all my clothes
I might need a little help
But it's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
I think it's safe to say
I'll make a few new friends
Take us out at a bar
Throw a beer on the band
Toss down head into a parking lot road
And I wouldn't be surprised
If my ex shows up
Huggin' all over some dude in his truck
I guess down here
That's the way things go
But I'll be fine
'Cause all I know
It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
It's a shore thing,
The sun will be shinning,
On my cold drink,
And I'll be lying
On a miller light towel
Havin' happy hour
All day long in the sand
We may never sleep
We may never leave
Raise too much hell
Never make bail
But in the morning it'll be alright
'Cause it's a shore thing
We're getting tore down tonight
'Cause it's a shore thing

Tell you how I'm gonna take your cares away

You make me want to roll down the river and around the bend
Love you like a story with a happy ending
You make me want to
You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
You make me want to
You make me want to hang up the phone ride across town
Walk through you door and lay it down
Kiss you 'til you feel the truth
Yeah, you make me want to
You can blame it on my southern boy ways
Why I'm always running away
I don't know if I can ever change
But you make me want to
Yeah, you make me want to

TITLE: Here's To The Farmer
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Talk about an uphill battle
2000 acres of beans and cattle
But he don't ever get rattled
He just goes 'til the sun goes down
Hydraulic fluid on his jeans
Red dye diesel and ten rows between
A cold one on the porch and a good nights of sleep
Y'all hold 'em up with me now
Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer
Subdivision's creeping on in
Neighborhood kids keep jumping his fence
He could double his money
But that'd be the end of a promise he'll never break
Cause he looked his daddy in the eye
And he's got that stubborn pride
He'll be here 'til the day he dies
No, he wouldn't have it any other way
Here's to the farmer that plants the fields in the spring
That turn from green to that harvest honey
Hold one up for the banker downtown
That got him on his feet with handshake money
Here's to the farmer's wife
That loves him every night
Raising a son, raising a daughter
They gather 'round the table, send it up to the Father
Somehow they get closer when times get harder
Here's to the farmer
Yeah, here's to the farmer that loves his day in the sun
Won't sell that old half-ton
Nobody knows better 'bout a hard-earned dollar
Just tell him how far he's gotta go and he'll go further
Here's to the farmer
Here's to the farmer
Thank you, boys

TITLE: Land Of A Million Songs
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
You don't know why, you can't make it stop
You were hooked with your daddy's hand-me-down flat top
The first time that you made your first love cry
And the words you wrote were running from her eyes
Down on the paper, made you feel so alive
So you packed up your pickup and crossed that Tennessee line
You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
Find your old guitar, write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Everybody's got a story that needs to be sold
And they pray someday they'll hang a little gold
And ride back to their hometown with their head held high
On any given day, there's a dream, there's a chance
That lightning will strike at the end of a pen
And all the leaving, and losing, will all be worth the fight
So you're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told you don't belong
You take that loan dot job just to pay the rent
You learn a few things from them hard-working men
You listen to 'em laugh and you listen to 'em curse
You find your old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
Some will come and some will go
If you don't lay it all out there, you'll never know
You're always searching for a little something different to say
And the Bible from a woman who's standing on the stage
You get told you're fitting in, you get told, boy, you don't belong
You drink too much in a smokey little bar downtown
Stumble home when it's time to throw in the towel
Wake up in the morning, look out, and the sunlight hurts
You find that old guitar and write down another verse
In the land of a million songs
Oh oh oh

Girl I'll be over there
With my buddies drinkin' beer
If you need me, come and get me
When you hear our song
In a little while
When you're ready shoot me that smile
That way I'll know, that its time to go
You got your buzz on
We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Nothin' like love in a college town
All the rumors fly
Did you here who hooked up last night?
Thought she was all about, cause all she talked about
Was some old boy back home
There's old what's his name
He just can't seem to graduate
Hittin' on the new crop, buyin' 'em lemon drops
Man that's just wrong
We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's take another shot, drink another round
Hug on one another, talk about each other
Stay until they kick us out
Feels like love in a college town
I'm gonna fail this test
Thinking 'bout your dress
Layin' on my floor
Runnin' out the door
8.8 BAC, that sounds good to me
We won't ever look as good as we do now
So let's give it one more shot
Baby how's that sound?
Hug on one another, kiss on each other
In the morning we can chalk it down
As love in a college town
Gotta' love love in a college town

Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Not one time, baby

When its tepid on the roof, ain't nothing like you
Doing what you do to me
When the lightning hits, I'll be kissing on your lips
Girl, the rest is history
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we're better off, under covers
Yeah, we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no, no, no, no
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
Love, we can laugh it off
We both know we better off, under covers
Yeah we might not string all the good times together
But one thing's certain, not one time never, no
Baby, we ain't never been
We ain't never been bad lovers
Baby, we ain't never been
Baby, we ain't never been bad lovers
No, no, no

TITLE: Spring Break-Up
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
It was the last night at the Holiday Inn
There was a fire on the beach
I was tryin' to talk to some other girl
And she was bird dogging me
I finally had enough
I pulled her over to the side
Brushed her hair back
And looked her straight in the eye
It was a spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
We gotta little drunk and had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby, bye bye, bye bye bye bye
Baby, bye bye, bye bye bye bye
No I don't need your number
Don't wanna be your facebook friend
I hate to break it to ya
But you won't ever see me again
If I'm a bad guy
Well I don't mean to be
But there's a beach full of buddies
Acting just like me
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we gotta little drunk, we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up, baby bye bye
Bye bye to the night that we shared
The memories we made on that ol' beach chair
So long to the beer in that kiss
Hope it don't take you long to get over this
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
I know we gotta little drunk and had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Spring break-up, baby don't cry
You ain't from here and neither am I
We gotta little drunk, and we had a good time
Now it's a spring break-up
Baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye
Baby bye bye, bye bye bye bye

TITLE: Southern Gentleman
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
You looked at me like I was crazy
When I said ma'am to that little old lady
You ain't heard talk like that lately
But I can see, it's got you smilin'
And you say you still remember
Our first date me cookin' you dinner
And how I didn't even try to kiss you
At the end of the date
Cause I was raised
Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge, see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman
I'm gonna, open up these plantation blinds
To the sun coming up in your pretty blue eyes
Tell you you're beautiful a thousand times a day
'Til your in love with the way that I
Stand up when you walk in the door
Spin you around an old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge, see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman
Girl I'm gonna take you on a trip like back in time
Just put your hand in mine, and won't you
Come here when you walk in the door
Let me spin you around this old heart pine floor
Rock you baby on a wraparound porch
Underneath a magnolia blossom
Walk you down old live oak road
Barefoot bridge see a sunset show
Say I love you when I pull you close
And you know it's true, as the gospel
Ain't nobody gonna love you better than
Can't nobody gonna love you better than
This southern gentleman

TITLE: Your Mama Should've Named You Whiskey
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
Just a little taste
Won't hurt at all
But once I get a sippin
Know I'm gonna wanna drink it gone
All gone
Ninety proof is an understatement
I get around you and I'm way past wasted
I can't think at all
Your mama should've named you Whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
And every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you Whiskey
Girl you got a smile like the devil on my shoulder
Tempted me saying, "Honey come over now"
Right now
I know I shouldn't wanna
But I think I'm probably gonna
Even though I know I'm gonna be
Waking up hurting in the morning
Should've come with a warning
Your mama should've named you Whiskey
I never should've let you kiss me
Yeah and every time you leave it hits me
Your mama should've named you Whiskey
I'm addicted girl
I'm hanging on
I'm a fool in love
I'm long past gone
Yeah so come on
Your mama should've named you Whiskey
And I never should've let you kiss me
Oh and every time you leave it hits me
Oh baby
Your mama should've named you Whiskey
I'm addicted girl
Such a fool
I'm addicted girl
Such a fool

TITLE: Good Directions
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
I was sittin' there
Sellin' turnip's on a flat bed truck
Crunchin' on  a pork rhine when she pulled up
She had be thinkin' this is where rednecks come from
she had Hollywood written on her license plate
she was lost and lookin' for the interstate
needin' directions
and I was the man for the job
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop in an' ask Mrs. Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
I was sittin' there
Thinkin' bout her pretty face
Kickin' myself for not catchin' her name
I threw my hat
And though you fool
It coulda been love
I new my old ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old coke sign
You gotta stop in an' ask Mrs. Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me
Or am I really seein' what I think I see
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why but somethin' felt right
When she stopped in an' asked Mrs. bell for some of her sweat tea
Momma gave her a big ol' glass and sent her right back here to me
Thank god for good directions
And turnip greens

TITLE: In Love With The Girl
ARTIST: Luke Bryan
LYRICS:
It feels like I woke up one mornin'
And it all changed without warnin'
I don't know how our paths crossed
But all I know is I've been lost
Now it's hard to think
That we were ever strangers
Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancin on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singin'
Or the way it all happened without even thinkin'
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl
I talk about bein' caught off guard
Talk about an old boy fallin' hard
Think about a few weeks flyin' by
And talk about losin' track of time
Now I'm countin' every second until I see her
Was it the wine or the moonlight glow
Or the way we were dancin on that old dirt road
Was it the sweet song she was singin'
Or the way it all happened without even thinkin'
I've been on the edge I've been on the brink
But I don't think I've ever been this far
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl
I was cool with hangin around
Now I got plans bigger than this town
Sayin things I ain't never said
And bein with her ever chance I get
Heard the old man say son when you know
Hold on tight and don't let go
So yes I, whoa yes I, yes I'm in love with the girl

TITLE: Rockstars
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
We take a drive just to sing along
Every word to them rollin' stones
Stacey's mom had it going on
Lived three doors down I can see her now
Her daughter had a heart that was wild and free
If you Blink 182 then you'd miss me
And her, every verse had a story
Yeah them parkin' lotter nights lit up our days of glory
Back when the engine starts were the only sound and
You'd strum the chords and I'd put the petal down
Two man dashboard pound rollin' through this town
And that rearview shakin' to the kick drum beatin'
And the west coast deep in the bucketseats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
(Alot of background singing)
Back when we were rockstars
Nothin' like freedom two windows down
You singin' along still here and now
Way too loud and sometimes off key
But you sounded like an angel to me
You'd make fun of how I threw my hair and threw my fingers up in the air
Thought I was Kurt Cobain or Jimmy Hayes,
Side seat centre stage,
Back when the engine starts were the only sound and
You'd strum the chords and I'd put the petal down
Two man dashboard pound rollin' through this town
And that rearview shakin' to the kick drum beatin'
And the west coast deep in the bucketseats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
Back when we were rockstars
Never ended up on MTV
Or heard our voices on a CD
But in your eyes and in my heart
We were eachother's rockstars
Back when the engine starts were the only sound and
You'd strum the chords and I'd put the petal down
Two man dashboard pound rollin' through this town
And that rearview shakin' to the kick drum beatin'
And the west coast deep in the bucketseats
All I ever wanted was right there in that car
Back when we were rockstars
Back when we were rockstars
Back when we were rockstars
You and me were rockstars
Yeah we were runnin' all night chasin' down a dream
Howlin' at the moon baby you and me
Sorry lots of mistakes, please fix

TITLE: Hit The Gas
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
The first day we met I was seventeen
The sky was shining bright
And the grass was green
You had your hair up
A smile on your face
I'll never forget that day
You walked up to me
And asked for a ride
I had a buddy in the front
So I pushed him aside
Put your seatbelt on
Throw your feet on the dash
And said boy please try not to crash
Then I winked back said
Baby don't you trust me?
Then I hit the gas
I just want to go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you want to go back
Baby it's too late for that I hit the gas
We pulled in about ten past 12
I dropped you off, daddy's givin' me hell
You threw your hands up gave me a grin
You jumped back in and said let's do it again
Then I hit the gas
I just want to go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
If you want to go back
Baby it's too late for that I hit the gas
I know you're just a small town girl
So just give me the chance
And I'll show you the world
So come on baby
I just want to go fast
I want this feeling to last
So I hit the gas
I just want to go fast
I want these feelings to last
So I hit the gas
So I hit the gas

Oh Mr. Jackson cuts his grass after church on his tractor only after listening to the country countdown
He remembers all the 3 court sessions, giving lessons, never guessing, we go from dive bars to sold out
He just smiles, can't help but grin when he turns that dial on the FM
Here's an old friend, he can't believe it
Ain't that what it's all about, what it's all about, yeah
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make them turn it up loud, roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give them that sound, everybody's talking about
We still the same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We're singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud, make my hometown proud
All the whining through the years, all the grinding of the gears, all the passion and the tears, man it paid off
All the places that we see, all the people that we meet, it still feels like a dream that we're living off
It ain't the laughs and fame, it ain't the smoking flame
It's that sweet artist smile on my mama's face
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make them turn it up loud, roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give them that sound, everybody's talking about
We still the same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice
We're singing now
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make my hometown proud, make my hometown proud
In every song, every way
In every move I've ever made
That's right, North West Georgia, where you all at?
In every song, every way
In every move I've ever made
Chattanooga, Tennessee, turn it up
Come on
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Make them turn it up loud, roll them windows down
All I wanna do is make my hometown proud
Gonna give them that sound, everybody's talking about
We still the same old, same old southern boys
Still got that same old, same old southern voice

Life was great, would not change a thing
I had it all but with you I had more
But out of nowhere out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl I'm drowned and drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say its over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober
I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Brokenhearted with a pounding head
And I know I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name
Your face
This pain I can't erase
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
I couldn't get enough
Girl I'm drowned and drunk in love

Passed our exit five ago
Four lanes to county roads
Playlist lighting up the dark
808's and pounding hearts
Won't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Girl don't you know I got the key to your heart
In my car, let's go far
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there's no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shining
County riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines
As they blur by
'Til there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Static building up in here
Where you take me, I don't care
The further we get, the closer we are
Blurring the lines under midnight stars
Won't tell nobody where we're going
Just you and me and the headlights glowing
Yeah boy, I know you got the key to my heart
In your car, take me far
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there's no cares
Me and you out there all alone
Moonlight shining
County riding
Not one bar on our phones
Counting the white lines

'Til there's gravel on the ground
They won't find us if we don't wanna be found
Lost in the middle of nowhere

We're young and the highway 
Goes on forever
Come on girl, no time to waste
it's now or never
We're young and the highway

And ever and ever
Lost in the middle of nowhere
Where there is no cares
Me and you out here all alone (out here all alone)

Name on your phone says caller unknown
But girl you ain't foolin' me
I can see it in your eyes and all the shh you hide
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses
Say you're out with your friends, try to pretend
Like I don't know what you're doing
It's funny to me, the joke is on you
And girl I see through it
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid
Girl you ain't foolin' me
All your excuses, they're always in the way
Do you think that I'm stupid, make a new one everyday
But you can't lie, girl I ain't blind
If love is just a game you play, well then you're losin'
Stupid excuses

TITLE: Setting The Night On Fire
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
10 p.m., most folks are sleeping
But it's the weekend
So we ain't, and we know where the cows don't go
These 40 inch tires seen enough pavement
So we're taking them on red dirt place somewhere offroad
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Round here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Girls showing up late as always
Now it's a party
Cut off sun dresses, they're ready to go
Don't need no dance road tonight
Just country music and good times
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire, on fire, on fire
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
You won't find us at no bar
I'll tell you right where we are
No where, no rules
Crack a Bud Light, get into the groove
Dancing in the middle of the night in the middle of a field
Just turning it loose
Hell yeah, that's us
Don't need a downtown to get to tearing it up
Out here, just watching the stars get bright
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Setting the night on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire), on fire (on fire)
Yeah
Setting the night on fire
On fire

TITLE: Memory
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Am I the only one that's comin' unglued?
Emotions buildin' up, they start to run you
Bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through
Doin' everything I wish that I can undo, ayy
I'm by myself
And why won't no one help?
I know this can't be healthy
So I'm lookin' for a way out
I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
And I don't wanna be a memory
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Tryna find the beauty in the let down, goin' through my texts now
Tryna find the things I never said to prove a point
I'ma roll my feelings in a joint
Pieces of the story that got left out, I checked out
Wish it was, I wish it was, I wish it was a phase
Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
Runnin' from the, runnin' from the, runnin' from the pain
I gotta get away
(I gotta get away, gotta get away, gotta get away)
I wanna live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Live life fast, I don't know how to slow down
Wanna get high, I don't know how to come down
Help me now, I'm runnin' on empty
And I don't wanna be a memory
Am I the only one that's comin' unglued?
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
These bottles on the shelf I'm 'bout to run through
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
I'm by myself and why won't no one help?
(And I don't wanna be a memory)
I know this can't be healthy so I'm lookin' for a way out

I've been thinkin' 'bout ya lately
Reminiscin', goin' crazy
Miss the way your kiss would keep me up
Ayy, wish that you were here tonight
Drinkin' vodka soda, extra limes
And we could just get back to bein' us
'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah
Do you ever think about
The days we couldn't live without each other?
Where the hell did we go wrong?
Ayy, how'd we go from that to this?
How'd we let a good thing slip?
Do we really have to go move on?
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

Cool again

LYRICS:
Learning, learning, learning 
Learning, learning, learning 
When I was six years old, I kinda wet the bed 
My stepdad came in and nearly beat me to death
Learning, learning, learning
Learning, learning, learning
When I was six years old, I kinda wet the bed
My stepdad came in and nearly beat me to death
All bruised and broken, I was lonely and scared
My mom, she was working, there was nobody there
My nana showed up, she was super protective
Had a tear in her eye, she saw how I was neglected
The crazy part about it, she's a straight-up detective
But you never would've guessed it, how she'd cook you a breakfast
Three weeks later, she had him locked in a cell
Now I'm seven years old with a story to tell
Sing it
I'm gonna let it go
Forgiveness is something we gotta know
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
Now middle school's here, a new chapter in life
New stepdad, too, made my mama his wife
Got new problems now, like tryna fit in
Getting looked down on just because of your skin
It's bad enough, I can't afford them clothes
Got high water's on with holes in my sole
Now, that's the type of stuff to put a hole in your soul
But, uh, I'm just gonna, uh, I'm just gonna
I'm gonna let it go
Forgiveness is something we gotta know
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
I'm grown up now, I learned enough for a song
Still got some friends, but most of 'em gone
Overdoses or killed by a gun
Breaking into houses, life on the run
Did it for his kid, now he won't be around
Guess the little one's gonna be just like me now
If you're carrying the bitterness around on your shoulders
Then just remember what I told you
Sing it
I'm gonna let it go
Forgiveness is something we gotta know
'Cause if you hold on forever, it'll hurt your soul
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
That's why I'm learning how to let it go
I'm learning how to let it go

Your lips, your eyes, don't wanna let go
Your skin on mine, I'm losing control
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind coming off your breathe
Your curves ain't slow me down
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
You're fire, I'm lightning 
We're burning at the core
Falling and crashing
Girl we're a perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide
I can feel our love come alive
It's the same, baby
We're like thunder in the rain
Twisted, tangled like a hurricane
We shake these walls like an earthquake
Hear the rumble in your chest
Feel the wind coming off your breathe
Awake, calling out my name
Makes me hard to contain
You're fire, I'm lightning 
We're burning at the core
Falling and crashing 
Girl we're the perfect storm
Every time our hearts collide

LYRICS:
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
I picked you up with the cowboy nod
At the hotel bar
It was less than 8 seconds
Girl, you stole my heart
We had drinks and smokes
Played you songs on guitar
I was crazy out the gate
And you were wild from the start
You hopped in my Bronco
And we had the time of our lives
We've come a long way since then girl
But it's been one hell of a ride
Love is like a rodeo
Tryna see how far we go
After one touch
Became obsessed with the rush
Yeah love is like a rodeo
I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall
But we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo
Girl there's something kinda dangerous
About the way you move
I knew it wouldn't be easy
Hanging onto you
'Cause when you hit the lights
Put your lips on mine
It gets hotter than a Houston night
Yeah love is like a rodeo
Tryna see how far we go
After one touch
Became obsessed with the rush
Yeah love is like a rodeo
I just wanna steal the show
We fight and we fall
But we keep holding on
Love is like a rodeo, rodeo, rodeo, rodeo

TITLE: Last Time I Say Sorry
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
The first time I slept on the couch, was our first New Year's Eve
I heard words come out my mouth, that I still can't believe
Broken hearts and shattered champagne
We both don't wanna feel that again
The second I apologized you said, "Boy, I don't know"
I said it 'cause I meant it, but you still wouldn't let it go
So I swallow my pride, see it from your side
I promise I'll do the best I can do
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh (Oh)
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
The last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry
If I could build a perfect world I'd only make you smile
I'd hang the stars, the sun and moon outside this room but I'll
I'll never be perfect, though I'm gonna try
Oh, I'm gonna do better I swear that I
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh (Oh)

It could be a black dress, high heels
Ripped up, torn up Lucky Jeans
Or the covers in the morning
Her boyshorts and my favorite tee
Unbuttoned flannel layin' on the floor
Lingerie hangin' out the back of the door
I swear it don't matter what it is
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right
It won't take long 'til you can't say no
She walks in, she's gonna steal the show
She puts it on and on and on and on
'Cause she knows she can pull it off
Oh yeah
The way she wears my flatbill way better than me
Got me wanting everything underneath
Those blue eyes lookin' back at me
Looks like that can change everything
I swear
She puts it on like it was made for her
The kind of thing you can't teach or learn
She puts it on on a Friday night
Everything she does, she does just right

Well, you do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine, so
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
We'll lie and swear we're through
With the lonely, drunken deja vu
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Five minutes out of downtown

TITLE: Forgetting Is The Hardest Part
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
There's no doubt it was always you
From that first time I walked you home from school
Until you stole my heart underneath that August moon
It was always you it was always you
Now it hurts to see your pretty smile fade
I've got a front row seat to watch you drift away
And I know there's nothing left for us to say
But it's okay it's okay
There's no getting over you
I tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting
Forgetting is the hardest part
Sometimes I sit here feeling like a ghost
Its that emptiness I think that hurts the most
But a piece of me still holds a little hope
I should just let go
But I can't let go
There's no getting over you
I tried to sugarcoat the truth
But the missing you is tearing me apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting 
Forgetting is the hardest part
It's time to pull myself together
And put these pieces back wherever
Maybe one day I'll find love again
Again
There's no getting over you
I've tried to sugarcoat the truth
A million times but I'm still torn apart
Every kiss that I let slip away
Every minute every single day
The memories make it easy to break a heart
But forgetting 
Forgetting is the hardest part

Just a deep south home crowd 
With nothing to do and nothing to lose 
The same old paper and same old news
Just a slow down small town
Just a deep south home crowd
With nothing to do and nothing to lose
The same old paper and same old news
We'd ride around 10: 30 on a Friday
We'd hurry to a parkin lot
With all our friends
Turning up the heat when
We finally made it to the weekend
We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going
As long as we were going wide open
She was made for the fast lane
She was more than just a pretty face
First time lover, we spent that summer
Doing nothing but getting away
We put the gas to the floor
Yeah, we hit it wide open
Two-lane highway rolling
With no one around, slowing us down
Radio loud, had the speakers all blowing
Dials wide open
Feet on the dash with her hand out the window
Smiling a look in her eye letting me know
She didn't care where we were going

Six months passed since we both said goodbye
Never thought that I'd run into you here tonight
And I can't ever think your smile's the same as it was back when I saw you every day
I probably shouldn't say it
What I'm about to say
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world people wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back
You haven't stopped me yet so I guess I'll keep going on
Oh, and I haven't even deleted your number from my phone
I've been wanting to call you every single day but I couldn't think how to rephrase everything
So just tell me, babe
If you feel the same way
We could make a comeback if you come back
We were on top of the world people wanted what we had
We could have it again don't you know that
We could make a comeback if you come back
We could make a comeback if you just come back
We could make a comeback if you come back

Barefoot front porch swingin', here all alone 
Tracing my steps tryna figure out what went wrong
You were here one minute then the next you leave
Now I'm stuck here tryna breathe
You know that saying "it ain't you, it's me"
But it ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale
It ain't you riding 'round this town
With a ghost in the shotgun seat
It ain't you that's been tryna call
It ain't you that still misses it all
You ain't the one that can't move on, still holding memories
It ain't you, it's me
I found some stuff I just couldn't throw away
Some old T-shirts and pics of us in a frame
I talk to the walls like feel my pain
'Cause the echo of you was here today
I'm just stuck tryna find what it means
It ain't you, it's me
But it ain't you that's been going through hell
It ain't you with a heart for sale

If life's just wakin' up to
Another day of lookin' at you
If all we get is just to be together
It makes me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever
You tell yourself that you'll never grow old
'Til you find the hand you were meant to hold
Now I never wanna see you one last time
I never wanna know a kiss goodbye
If life's just wakin' up to
Another day of lookin' at you
If all we get is just to be together
It makes me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever
If life's just more of the same
Makin' you smile, sayin' your name
If all we get is just to be together
You make me wanna live forever
If life's just wakin' up to
Another day of lookin' at you
If all we get is just to be together
It makes me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever
You make me wanna live forever

TITLE: It Turns Me On
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
She throws her Braves cap on her head every time it rains
And when her favorite song comes on, she sings out of key as it plays
Always leavin' the car on empty and blamin' me for what she did
But when we talk about our future or the name of our first kid
It's kinda crazy but turns me on, how she's always blowin' up my phone
It's not some cover girl on a magazine, it's the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in, not them long tan legs or her perfect tint
Its the imperfections that she wants gone, it's kinda crazy but turns me on
I love to give her silent treatment when she throws her little fits
Thinkin' she's gonna get her way as she pokes out her bottom lip
When she makes her funny faces and does her best British accent
Or when she says that shes not hungry, and then I get mine and she digs in
It's kinda crazy but turns me on how shes always blowin' up my phone
It's not some cover girl on a magazine, it's the one I fell in love with at 17
An addictive drug that pulled me in, not them long tan legs or her perfect tint
It's the imperfections that she wants gone, it's kinda crazy but turns me on
It turns me on
An addictive drug that pulls me in, not them long tan legs or her perfect tint
It's the imperfections that she wants gone, it's kinda crazy but turns me on
Yeah, yeah, oh, it turns me on
Yeah, it turns me on

TITLE: ParaÃ­so (Heaven)
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
É perfeito 
Vem me beijar outra vez 
Só você me deu motivos pra sonhar 
Você e eu aqui, é mágico sentir
É perfeito
Vem me beijar outra vez
Só você me deu motivos pra sonhar
Você e eu aqui, é mágico sentir
Nunca fiquei tão bem assim
Será mesmo que o paraíso é lindo do jeito que é o nosso amor?
Pode ser loucura comparar, mas é isso
E aqui nessa cama, te olhando assim, não vou me convencer
Como pode? Como pode o céu, o céu
Ser melhor que você?
Kane Brown, faz barulho aê
I swear you're an angel
Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?
I could stay here forever
I'd be fine if we never had to even leave this room
Everybody's talking 'bout heaven like they just can't wait to go
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
Lying next to you, in this bed with you, I ain't convinced 'cause
I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this
Não é melhor que você
Será mesmo que o paraíso é lindo do jeito que é o nosso amor?
Saying how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful
E aqui nessa cama, te olhando assim, não vou me convencer
Como pode? Como pode o céu, o céu
Ser melhor que você? (Heaven)
Ser melhor que você? (Heaven, heaven)
I swear this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time

TITLE: My Where I Come From
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
There's a few more churches than there are bars
A hell of a lot more trucks than there are cars
If the sun's still hangin' in the sky
Work day still ain't done
Where I come from
You bow your head and pray before you eat
There ain't a single stranger on the streets
There's a lot of nowhere towns out there
But for me there's only one
Where I come from
So if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how to back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out
When I shake your hand I'ma look you in the eye
And if I'm wrong, I'll apologize
I'm still tryin' to live by a couple things I picked up
Where I come from
So if I like my music just a little too loud
And I got a couple tattoos to show my Georgia pride
And if what's on my mind is what's comin' out my mouth
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out
Got a lot of good, got a little bit of bad from it
Made me what I am, got everything I have from it
So if I just won't turn down on a Saturday night
And if I never learn how to back down from a fight
And if I take my hat off for the stars and the stripes
And If I just can't seem to shut it down
That's just my "where I come from" comin' out
"Where I come from" comin' out

LYRICS:
I know I don't say "You're beautiful" enough
But that don't mean it ain't on my mind
And I know sometimes we have differences and fight
But I hate when I see you cry
And if you're ever worried I got one foot out that door
I can promise you right now baby
My love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talking us growing old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be going on and on baby
My love won't leave you alone
No
Just like that red wine stain on the carpet
Yeah, girl, I ain't going nowhere (hell nah)
And kinda like your favorite jeans with a hole in the pocket
Wherever you go, I'll be there
'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talking us growing old

When I say forever girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go

LYRICS:
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind
You throw tantrums while I'm twisting up
No medicine is fixing us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinking
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (bad)
Sometimes it be like that
I cross the seas with you (ayy)
Wasn't even supposed to be with you (yeah)
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you
And I could keep you nice and warm
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love
If I was to give you the world (yeah)
That's anything that you can think of (yeah)
Got too much going to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend
I said I'm gonna be right back
It hurts sometimes it be like that
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad (bad)
Sometimes it be like that
Sometimes when you thought you found the love of your life
Now you're thinking I'm just one of those guys leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong
Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why, but tell you what
You got me thinking
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met yo' ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm moving on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that
Sometimes when you're falling off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry
'Cause we're both just out of our mind, yeah

TITLE: For My Daughter
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
Someone to play catch with, out in the backyard
To pick up the pieces of your first broken heart
Someone to say slow down when you turn sixteen
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
Someone to scare the monsters when it's dark in your room
Someone to put their foot down when you want a tattoo
And not just say I love you, but show you what it means
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
They say dads are supposed to shape you, in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
Someone to let you fall down and teach you how to get back up
And teach you how to be sweet like mama and how to be tough
Yeah, I'll never be perfect, but sure as those lines are pink
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
They say dads are supposed to shape you, in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
Mm, mm, mm
Yeah, I can't change the past, but the past has sure changed me, mm-mm-mm
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
I said I'm gonna be a dad and I'm gonna be the best one I can be
The best one I can be
Love you, baby girl

Good for nothin' phone in your hands

That's just started with that cover band
That old school radio station
Let's just drive until it's faded
Girl, let's lose it, tonight
'Cause when you do that thing right there
Flippin' your hair, baby, I swear
I don't think you know what you're doin' to me
You got my heart skip-skippin' a beat tonight
You're not close enough, so there's space between
You and me, let's lose it
The way you're dancin', swayin' to the music
Girl, that body, and how you move it
Every time you cross my mind
Girl, I lose it
Yeah, I lose it
Oh, oh
Yeah, I lose it
Let's start with them Lucchese's
Baby, kick 'em to the floorboard
Them bobby pins holdin' your hair up, girl
You don't need 'em no more
That dress hangin' off your shoulder
As you move a little closer
Yeah, let's lose it (lose it), tonight, yeah girl

Money in the bank, gas in the tank 
Say you wanna get a little crazy 
Your hands up on my knee, you're such a little tease 
I'm acting like it ain't gonna phase me
Money in the bank, gas in the tank
Say you wanna get a little crazy
Your hands up on my knee, you're such a little tease
I'm acting like it ain't gonna phase me
Girl tonight the world is ours
Shooting like some southern stars
From the backseat down a backstreet of your heart
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer
A little Waylon in truck, whiskey in my cup
Dancing with your back up on the console
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Put your fingertips in mine
Girl, pull me back until tomorrow
Set the evening sky on fire
Burning up with that desire
From the backseat down a backstreet in your heart
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days
I can't wait to get a taste
So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes
Heads back, curl up them toes
And get a little closer, a little closer
I know just what you do 
But when your body's movin
It's like you're saying 
Come, come and chase me 
Ain't got much love to prove 
I'm about to lose
And girl it's over
Just, just get closer 
I know just what you do 
But when your body's movin
It's like you're saying 
Come, come and chase me 
Ain't got much love to prove 
I'm about to lose
And girl it's over
Just, just get closer 
Ridin' these FM waves
Burnin' these reckless days

So get a little close, a little closer
Float in these country roads
Tearin' off each other's clothes

TITLE: Didn't Know What Love Was
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
Never been a hopeless romantic
Never really could understand it
I thought Hollywood was just pretending
In all them movies with happy endings
Never saw it work out, just drama
Started with my old man and my mama
Figured that's just the way it works
Someone always ends up getting hurt
I didn't know what love was
Thought it was just a word that people used
Until they say goodbye
'Til they go and find someone new
Thought I could live without it
But baby, I was wrong and so confused
I didn't know what love was, love was
Until you, yeah
Now you got my undivided attention
Publicly displaying my affection
Can't help kissin' on you all the time
Thank God I got to make you mine
'Cause I can't remember life before you
I'm obsessed with you, girl, I adore you, yeah
I'm convinced I was born to
Fall in love with you
I didn't know what love was
Thought it was just a word that people used
Until they say goodbye
'Till they go and find someone new
Thought I could live without it
But baby, I was wrong and so confused
I didn't know what love was, love was
Until you, yeah
I didn't know, I didn't know
Until you
I didn't know what love was
Thought it was just a word that people used
Until they say goodbye
'Till they go and find someone new

We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand
I can't sleep, gotta leave
The summer sun starting to peek through my window, letting me know
Time's up, it's time that we go
Got a lead foot waiting and a pocket full of cash
Cooler full of beer and a little sun stash
In the back of the car, so relax there ain't a beach to far
We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand (hell yeah)
In a tank top gonna let the guns out, all about rockin' that farmers tan
Got the Chev going seventy , all the girls looking heavenly 
But ya, kick back and chill out ahead of me
Getting wild, raising hell, and leaving this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
No tellin', no tellin'
But them lips taste like watermelon
Got a daiquiri kiss, I count when it hits
Makes you wanna get going there
Wherever that is
We'll be road trippin' rollin' with the top down, southbound 
Little bikinis and white sand (hell yeah)
In a tank top gonna let the guns out, all about rockin' that farmers tan
Got the Chev going seventy , all the girls looking heavenly 
But ya (hey) kick back and chill out ahead of me
Getting wild, raising hell, and leaving this town
Like there ain't no stopping us now
No there ain't no stopping us now
There ain't no stopping us now

I remember you in that jacked up jeep
Hair blowing sipping Mickey D's sweet tea
Cheap sunglasses and paisley boots
Long tan legs and those daisy dukes.
Stopping for every single yard sale sign
What I wouldn't give to do that one more time
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life so different since you cross those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and your miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go city on, don't go city on me
Never knew what city lights looked like
From the bed of a truck on a summer night sky
Traffic jams on a gravel road
Don't use miss our old blue whole?
You climbed up on that rock and you held my hand
So I'm gonna say this once again
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life so different since you cross those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and your miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go city on, don't go city on me
You threw me that key, gave me one last kiss
Said "girl it don't have to end like this"
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life so different since you cross those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back.
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and your miss me jeans

Don't go baby, don't go no
Don't go city on me

TITLE: Cold Spot
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
A cement building
White cinderblocks
And faded red lips
The sign read "Cold Spot"
He worked behind the counter
To them he was an old man
When my world was crumbling
My grandpa gave me his hand
It was crickets, minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the southern baptist bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter you saw it all
At the Cold Spot
It was cool in July, warm in December
If I live a hundred years
I'll always remember
The song and the hum of that old ceiling fan
And his North Georgia voice saying, "Buddy, you can"
Out here I'm just a kid trying to make a name
I am who I am because he raised Kane selling
Crickets and minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It's where you bought your tag for your white-tailed deer
Where the southern baptists bought the most beer
A hole in the wall with holes in the wall
From behind this counter you saw it all
At the Cold Spot
Oh yeah
At the Cold Spot
It was crickets, minnows and kerosene
RC, moon pies and a softball team
Learned about life
Learned about girls
Learned about livin' in this cold, cruel world
It was heaven on earth when my world was hell
And the big stores came and the business failed
But all my memories are alive and well
At the Cold Spot
Oh yeah
At the Cold Spot
Take me back to the Cold Spot

I'd be sittin' in the same old bar
Heart breakin' on a broken bar stool
Wishin' she'd come runnin' back
Runnin' from the past
Runnin' up the tab drinkin' for two
But that night my boys showed up
Dragged me out on the town, had to pick me up
I'd never know what I was missin' if they didn't
'Cause I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
The way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of somethin' new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Oh I'd never found you
Never found you
Yes to go out sometimes
But I don't never try to get that drunk
Now I can't even sleep because you're all over me
And she's all night keepin' me up
Yeah you talk to believe that a goodbye could be
So good to me
No I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to
They way you move
Had me first time feelin' in a while I should make one too
Sometimes the finish line is just the start of somethin' new
If I'd never lost her
Then I'd never found you
Oh I'd never found you
Uhmm, I'd never found you
And now I'm taking back the way I said I wish I've never met
Sometimes the things that don't work out
Couldn't work out any better
I'd never found you
No, I'd never found you
'Cause I'd never found you
At that random house party that I didn't even wanna go to

Driving down on back roads
Skipping down on traffic
Flipping through the radio
All I get is static
I don't mind the quiet
I guess I kind of like it
Better nothing at all
Than the sound of us crying
You said you didn't mean it
But it's still in my head
I learned it's no easier
To forgive and forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost more than I found
Sitting by the window waiting for your headlights
Been two damn days since you said goodbye
I was feeling lonely feeling like I made a mistake
Though I never forgive myself for your heart break
I said I didn't mean it
But it's still in your head
I've learned it's no easier
To forgive than forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost more than I found
Baby I can't explain
No, don't say anything (please)
No, it's too late
You said you didn't mean it
I said I didn't mean it
I learned it's no easier
To forgive that forget
We thought it was forever
Look at us now
Well I tried
And I lost
Well I tried

Everything we use to do went wrong
Haven't shed one tear since you've been gone
I got my pull out chair, football and beer
Ain't got one worry 'cause girl you ain't here
I got my freedom back, I'll do whatever I want
I guess this is how its suppose to be
I can't believe it took this long for me to see
That I love that I hate you
I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you
Hasn't been so bad
It's the best time of the year
'Cause I see you and I see him
You know I can't help but grin
'Cause soon enough he'll be singing it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
Ooh-ooh
I love that I hate you
Any other break up I'd be jealous
You can't hide behind the make up, girl you're selfish
Got another man following you around
Like a dog doing trick to your every sound
I can't belive that use to be me
And that use to be us
I love that I hate you
I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you
Hasn't been so bad
It's the best time of the year
'Cause I see you and I see him
You know I can't help but grin
Cause soon enough, he'll be saying it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
Ooh-ooh
I love that I hate you
I love that I hate you
Never thought that I could make it through
But I am fine on my own, with my middle finger salute
That I love that I hate you
I can't stop thinking about the time that you're not here
It's going on without you
Hasn't been so bad
It's the best time of the year
'Cause I see you and I see him
You know I can't help but grin
'Cause soon enough he'll be singing it too
Girl, I love that I hate you
Ooh-ooh
I love that I hate you

TITLE: Better Place
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
Baby, if your dream is forty acres and a house
Porch going all the way around
I'mma buy it
Or if you'd rather see
City lights and a crowd
I'mma move you uptown
It don't matter to me
Nah, it don't girl
Baby, I can see me livin' anywhere with you so
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place
If all you wanna wear is faded blue jeans and a tee
Oh baby, that's fine with me
You look good in anything
Aw, but girl I swear
If you wanna hit the town in a dress, turn a few heads
I ain't gonna stop you
Baby, I got you, oh
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place
Every night (every night)
And every day
You're my everything
Til we fade away
Til the sky falls and the good Lord calls us up
You're the only girl I wanna love
Til I'm pushing up daisies
Wanna stare into your green eyes, baby
Til we're hand-in-hand walking down them streets of gold
Six feet below, you know
I'm gonna make your world a better place
Til we're both in a better place
Til we're both in a better place

Hmmm, this is perfect
Come kiss me one more time
I couldn't dream this up
Even if I tried
You and me in this moment
Feels like magic only
I'm right where I wanna be
Everybody's talkin' about heaven like they just can't wait to go
Sayin' how it's gonna be so good, so beautiful

'Cause, I don't know how, I don't know how heaven, heaven
Could be better than this

Sent to this world
What did I do right to deserve you, girl?

TITLE: Worldwide Beautiful
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
White churches, black churches
Different people, same hearses
It's kinda hard to fight with each other
Laying down in the ground, six under
At every show I see my people
They ain't the same, but they're all equal
One love, one God, one family
You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful
Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
Coast to coast, city to city
Reach out your hands if you're with me
Still got some work but we still got a dream
Every shade, every heart come together and sing
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God (woo)
You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful
One love, one God, one family (one family, y'all, c'mon)
One love, one God, one family 
One love, one God, one family 
One Love, one God, one family (sing it with me)
You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable (we're not that different)
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful
Look around and see worldwide beautiful (so beautiful)
Look around and see worldwide beautiful

TITLE: Whiskey Sour
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
We were two heartbeats away
From wedding rings and a pretty ballgown dress
At the church off 40 West
And we were talking 'bout our future on the steps
Of your daddy's screened in porch
That if I'd ask, you'd tell me, "Yes"
Well, it only took a month or so to be someone you used to know
You didn't really have to go, but you did
And I've never been a somber soul
But part of me ain't here no more
And I've been tryna find him ever since
So now I take my whiskey sour
Sittin' barside after hours
Thinkin' how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours alone
'Cause that one night under neon
Was the first time you ordered me one
And you told me that you love me
But was it ever true?
'Cause your promises were empty
Now I'm drinking one too many
Drowning out the memory of you
So now I take my whiskey sour
Sittin' barside after hours
Thinkin' how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours
And I don't know why I do it
It's supposed to help me through it
But it's harder when it always tastes like you
And every time I hit rock bottom
I don't know what I should do
Should I call you up again or should I settle for round two?
And just take my whiskey sour
Sittin' barside after hours
Thinkin' how can I get over if the love was never ours?
Hell, I know you got my message
All my X's and my O's
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours alone
And it kills me by the hour
Now I take my whiskey sours alone

TITLE: One Thing Right
ARTIST: Kane Brown
LYRICS:
I've cheated and I've lied
I've broke down and I've cried
I've got nothing to hide no more
I've loved and I've hurt
I've broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure
Known to be crazy, known to be wild
Mama had herself a little devilish child
Ain't no stranger to the troubles at my door (at my door)
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
'Cause I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
You saw right through my pain
Kept us patient while I change
Never even crossed your mind to walk away (to walk away)
When I was getting crazy, reckless and wild
Acting like my mama's little devilish child
It took a heart like yours to find its place (find its place)
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you
(Baby, I got one thing right)
I got one thing right
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, I got one thing right
I've been at the wrong place at the wrong time
Chasing all the wrong things most of my life
Been every kind of lost that you can't find
But I got one thing right (But I got one thing right)
Been the kind of guy girls' mommas don't like (mommas don't like)
Running with the wrong crowd on the wrong nights
I've been wrong about a million times
But I got one thing right, you
I got you

Remember when ninth grade was about gettin' laid
Skippin' class tryin' not to get caught

Scared to death that you might get shot

Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth and I just can't take it no more
So wake me up from this American bad dream
Is it this messed up, or is it really reality?
I'm becomin' numb to all of this tragedy
Somebody wake me up from this American bad dream (this American bad dream)
From this American bad dream (this American bad dream)
I remember doin' 10 over the limit would just get you a ticket
Just an inconvenience gettin' stopped
Bad cops played the jury, made the good ones worry
'Bout showin' up and doin' their job

Everybody started fallin' for the Devil's disguise
That hides behind the lines
That hide the truth and I just can't take it no more

You singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch 
Just laughing at the dogs 
How you swear you love me more 
When you're whispering goodnight

Just holding, onto you tonight until mornin'

If home is where the heart is

Sold out some little town I've never been before

I remember you in the rocking chair
I was in my boots and my underwear
Playing rodeo all night long
You used to count till it hit 8 seconds
When you hit 6 is the time you left us
But you're in my heart so I'll never be alone
I know you're watching over me
I hope one day I'll be the man you used to be
Quick to love and slow to anger
No, you never met a stranger
I hope one day when you're looking down on me
I make you smile
I make you proud
I may not be there now
But I hope one day I'll be man enough to be sitting there in my granddaddy's chair
You were 8 track tapes and Conway Twitty
Road trip with Nana to Panama City
Everybody knew she was your girl
You taught me love
You taught me living
Cars and jokes and good catfishing
I gave you hell and you gave me the world
I'm sure missing you right now

And all of them girls are getting pretty, putting on heels
'Cause downtown there's a cover band warming up for the fever jam
Blondes' in the bathroom washing X's off their hands
All of them party people stacking up in a line
Pushing up on each other like it's raining outside
But I'ma stay right here so we can disappear
Yeah, I've been waiting all night
Take me to the party girl in the same t-shirt
That you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that we're spinning, bare feet on the floor
And the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall
Like a beauty queen, long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl (party girl)
(Party girl)
I don't need all them humming, buzzing neon signs
Long as you got that come and get me look in your eyes
Yeah I'ma stay right here, so we can disappear
We can do it up right
Take me to the party girl in the same t-shirt
That you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that we're spinning, bare feet on the floor
And the living room light got me begging for more
Of that party girl strutting down the hall
Like a beauty queen, long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl
Take me to the party girl
Wearing nothing but that t-shirt
Laying down on an old love seat
Nothing better than you and me
And that party girl in the same t-shirt
That you wear to bed while the ceiling fan turns
To the rhythm that we're spinning, bare feet on the floor
And the living room light got me begging for more (you got me beggin' for more)
Of that party girl strutting down the hall
Like a beauty queen, long legs and all
Got me melting in the cushion of an old love seat
Don't get much better than you and me
And this party girl (take me to the party)
Ain't nothing better than you and me, girl
Yeah, so gimme that, gimme that girl

TITLE: Give In To You
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
If two wrongs don't make a right
What do, two rights make?
'Cause I'm holding onto something I just can't shake
Closed a million doors, but they won't stay shut
I see you and I break, you know, it don't take much
Hmm, yeah, it don't take much
Every time I say I won't, I know it ain't true
I always, always, always give in to you
I know that when I try to fight it, I lose
I always, always, always give in to you
(Give in to you, yeah)
But I don't mind that I do
(Give in to you, yeah)
I've wondered what it'd be like to forget your touch
Would I want it not at all, or twice as much?
In the back of my car, in the front yard
Saying we're gonna start learning our lesson, but
Every time I say I won't, I know it ain't true
I always, always, always give in to you
I know that when I try to fight it, I lose
I always, always, always give in to you
(Give in to you, yeah)
But I don't mind that I do
(Give in to you, yeah)
Yeah, in the back of my car, in the front yard
Saying we're gonna start learning our lesson, yeah
At the edge of my bed
Tryna take back
Everything that we had
But why would we go and do that?
Every time I say I won't, I know it ain't true
I always, always, always give in to you
I know that when I try to fight it, I lose
I always, always, always give in to you
(Give in to you, yeah)
But I don't mind that I do
(Give in to you, yeah)
Oh-oh, I always give in to you
(Give in to you, yeah)
But I don't mind if I do
(Give in to you, yeah)
I always give in to you

There's a two lane getaway red hot summer day
Jump into my '65 Mustang, ain't she a pretty thing?
Just like you, and it's burnin' me up, burnin' me up, burnin' me up
Yeah, tell me what I wanna hear
You're turnin' me on, turnin' me on, turnin' me on
Yeah baby let's get outta here
Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?
Pedal on the floorboard, lay a little bit of rubber down this road
Bass bumpin' on the car door
Got a blue sky, got a fast ride
Got all the time in the world so come on little girl
Whoa, all we gotta do is stop, let the top drop and roll
We can leave town right now, take it down the interstate
Just get gone
Oh baby we could just get lost
While the radio plays our favorite song
Well turnin' it up, turnin' it up, turnin' it up
That's just what I wanna hear
Burnin' me, up burnin' me up, burnin' me up,
Yeah baby let's get out of here
Do you wanna wanna, do you wanna wanna go?

LYRICS:
It was our first week, at Myrtle beach
Where it all began
It was a 102, nothin' to do
Man it was hot, so we jumped in
We were summertime sippin', sippin'
Sweet tea kissin' off of your lips
T-shirt drippin', drippin' wet
How could I forget?
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me
We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here
'Til the sun starts creepin', creepin' up
Right then I knew
Just what you were thinkin', thinkin' of
When I looked at you
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me
You and me
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful
Watchin' that blonde hair swing
To every song I'd sing
You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool
I can still hear that sound
Of every wave crashin' down
Like the tears we cried that day we had to leave
It was everything we wanted it to be
The summer of 19 you and me

TITLE: Lately
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
Lately
It's been hard to breathe
Just trying to keep my head above water
Sometimes life's in the way, all work and no play
And lately
It's been hard to see the way you used to be
And I wonder
If the words I don't say can make it okay
But I've been thinking 'bout us
And I know that the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough
So listen
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
That I get to call you mine
So baby, have I told you that I love you, lately?
Baby, we can stay at home or ditch the phone
Don't have to go nowhere
And get lost in your eyes
Let the time fly by
Baby, it don't matter what tomorrow brings
You know I'll be right there
Today and tonight, the rest of my life
I've been thinking 'bout us
And I know that the going is rough
And it feels like a little too much
Maybe I don't say it enough
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
That I get to call you mine
So baby, have I told you that I love you, lately?
Oh, yeah
Have I told you
Lately
Oh-oh, mmm
Have I told that I love you
That you're funny that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you? Mmm
Have I told you?
Girl, you know you're beautiful
I used to tell you all the time
But when you let your hair down, it still drives me crazy
You're beautiful
Gonna tell you all the time
'Cause when you let your hair down, it still drives me crazy
Something like a miracle
I can't believe that you're all mine
So baby, have I told you that I love you, lately?
Have I told you that I love you
That you're funny, that you're sweet
And I love what's outside and everything that's underneath
Lately
Have I told you that I miss you every second I'm asleep
And I love the way you smiling when I kiss you in my dreams
Have I told you?

All of my friends finally convinced
Me to get out of the house
To help me forget, to help me move on
Then I heard you're back in town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were comin', so
I should probably go to bed (ah)
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead (ah)
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' (in the mornin')
I'll be callin' (I'll be callin')
Sayin' sorry for the things I said

Is seein' your face and I'd forget
I should probably go to bed (ah)

Before I question my decision
Is it love? I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't
Have the self-control
To walk away if you walk in
Oh
I know, I know, I know, I know
I should probably go to bed
Ooh, I'm all up in my head (I'm all up in my head)

Holiday magic everywhere

Phones lighting up, grab my favourite shirt and my keys on the counter
'Cause you said you wanna dance
Halfway down the drive, must have changed your mind
It ain't even been an hour, tell me you've got other plans
I wouldn't be surprised if later or tonight
You're calling, begging me to come over
'Cause baby, I'm caught up in the back and forth

And I don't know what I do it for
You love me, you hate me
You make me, you break me
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, when you do what you do, 
It's like you do it on purpose
Got me spinning in circles
First you say you're mad, then you take it back
Like you've forgotten all about it

Oh
Its just another Friday
Staring at herself in the bathroom mirror
Its just another deep breath
Half an hour and he'll be here
Its just another friend of a friend
Oh, it ain't nothing
Its only just a drink or two
It'll be alright
She's putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick
Sitting at a red light
Staring at herself in the sideview mirror
He says shes beatiful (she's beautiful)
Like he knows what she wants to hear
So she plays right along as the night goes on
It'll only be a drink or two
She's putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it
She's putting on her lipstick
She's putting on her lipstick
So they drink and they dance
And he talks and she laughs
For a minute ain't nothing wrong
She's putting on her lipstick
Slippin' on her black dress
Turning up the music
Saying you can do this
Yeah you can do this
Putting on her lipstick
Turning up the music
Slippin' on her black dress
Saying you can do this
Climbing in the front seat
Looking out the window
Going through the motions
Trying just to let go
Of the tears that she cried, no solid goodbye
Tonight it ain't gonna show
And even though she knows that it ain't gonna fix it

All the evergreens
Would be decorated
And there'd still be a million lights
There'd still be mistletoe
But it wouldn't feel the same
'Cause all I know is
Christmas isn't Christmas if it's not with you
Red and green and silver bells would all be blue
All the presents are just boxes with no one to give them to
'Cause Christmas isn't Christmas if it's not with you
It'd be just a day at the end of December
And a lonely night if you and I weren't together
And those songs wouldn't sound the same
Home wouldn't feel like home
I'm thankful you're here tonight
'Cause all I know is
Christmas isn't Christmas if it's not with you
Red and green and silver bells would all be blue
All the presents are just boxes with no one to give them to
'Cause Christmas isn't Christmas if it's not with you
With you holding me close
Looking out the window
While we watch the snow come down
Oh, it's true
Christmas isn't Christmas if it's not with you

LYRICS:
Grandma and grandpa painted a picture of sixty-five years
And one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnight's and I love you's
Me and you baby, walk in the footsteps
Build our own family
One day at a time
Ten little toes, a painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
This life will go by
In the blink of an eye
But I wouldn't wanna spend it without you by my side
The cloud are gonna roll
The earth's gonna shake
But I'll be your shelter through the wind and the rain
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Now 'til forever it's all of me, all of you
Just take my hand
And I'll be the man your dad hoped that I'd be
And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
Someday we'll wake up
With thousands of pictures
Sixty-five years in this little house
I won't trade for nothing, the life that we built
I'll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still
And we'll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I'll stand through the good and the bad
We'll give all that we have
And we'll build this love from the ground up
From the ground up

Said some things I ain't proud of

Never meant to make you hurt like that, no

When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me, I hope you think good things
I hope you think good things
I hope you think good things
I hope you
Picture that night in Portland
We drank three bottles of wine
I said I love you 'bout a million times
And then we drove to Seattle
And just to kiss in the rain
Now when it's pourin', do you see my face?
So when it's late at night and you're still wide awake
If you're with your friends or you're lonely (you're lonely)
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me, I hope you think good things

When I held you for the first time
And every kiss that our lips made 
Feel like New Year's Eve at midnight
Think of the 3 AM conversations 
All of the big dreams that we were chasin' down
And if I ever cross your mind somehow

If you're with your friends or you're lonely
When you hear somebody start to say my name
Oh, when you think of me, I hope you think good things

Hey beautiful girl, in your own little world
And me in it
You got all of my attention
And you ain't even trying

Dancing in the rain no music

Something about you
Rocking that rock 'n roll t-shirt
We're at a party dressed up
But you just doing your thing
Ain't nobody ever seen nothin' like you
When you're wearing them worn out jeans
Purple untied shoestrings
You're a light in the dark
And you're stealing my heart like a gypsy
I love the way that you kiss me
In front of everybody
So baby come and kiss me

You and me and these headlights
Engine idling in your drive
Forty-five and a goodbye, yeah
I should probably get to going
Sun will rise before we know it
But while the moon is still glowing
Let me leave a little taste on your lips
Little chill running under your skin
So when it's a quarter past three, you're still thinking 'bout me
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss ya 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be what keeps you up at night, yeah
A little spray of my cologne
All over your pillow
So, still feels like I'm so close
Let me leave my shape in your bed
Let me leave a little song in your head
Make you dance in the dark like your still in my arms
Girl, I wanna be what keeps you up at night
Tossing and turning, head spinning like you're dizzy off of red wine
Oh, I wanna kiss ya 'til I can't get off your mind
Girl, I wanna be, wanna be what keeps you up at night

And I'm the only thing on your brain

You're calling out the constellations

The summer freckles on your face, and I
You're calling out the constellations
I swear you know them all by name
I see the moon accentuating
The summer freckles on your face, and I
Already miss right now
And I wish I could slow this down
Slow it down
'Cause time only moves in one direction
These are the nights we won't get back
Don't wanna waste one single second
Don't want the stars to fall so fast
'Cause someday we'll be saying how
We wish we could turn back around
Time only moves in one direction
Come on, get close, come let me hold you now
'Cause I just wanna memorize you
And every detail I can see
So even though we can't rewind it
I'll have a picture I can keep
'Cause I already miss right now
And I wish I could slow this down
Slow it down
'Cause time only moves in one direction
These are the nights we won't get back
Don't wanna waste one single second
Don't want the stars to fall so fast
'Cause someday we'll be saying how

Come on, get close, come let me hold you now
Nothing is forever
And now I'm just figuring out
That's what makes it better
So come let me hold you now
Oh
'Cause time only moves in one direction
These are the nights we won't get back
Don't wanna waste one single second
Don't want the stars to fall so fast

We wish we could turn back around
Time only moves in one direction
Come on, get close, come let me hold you now
Come let me hold you now

Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's 10, 000 hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now
Do you think of me?
When you close your eyes
Tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all
I'd spend 10, 000 hours and 10, 000 more

TITLE: Keeping Score
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
Someday we're gonna look back 
On a night like tonight
The car I pulled up in
The necklace you're wearing 
Won't even cross our minds
Someday we're gonna blink twice
Say it happens like that
How much money we saved up 
For the time that we gave up
Well, it'll all just be math
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just want to love you 
Like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
If we're rich to somebody
We're poor to somebody else
We could be happy and nameless
Or broken and famous
But, from what I can tell
Is that it doesn't really matter
You can't take with you when you go
Life is only getting faster (life is only getting faster)
So, baby, I'd rather 
Take tonight nice and slow
'Cause I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just want to love you 
Like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now
Be with me now
Be with me right now
Be with me right here, right now
I know I'm only human
Don't know how many sunsets I got left
And I don't wanna ruin
This moment by wondering what comes next
I just want to love you 
Like it's all I'm living for
Hold you close, enjoy you more
And spend a little less time keeping score
Oh, yeah

You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume
Is floatin' down the stairs
You're fixin' up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time, It's nothin' new
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
I'm speechless
Starin' at you, standin' there, in that dress
What it's doin' to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words out of my mouth without even tryin'
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you, standin' there, in that dress
What it's doin' to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous

1, 2, 3... Here we go
Yeah
I'ma walking out my front door
I'ma jumping in my car
Take another left on Main Street
Head right to where you are
I'ma rolling down my window
I'ma turn the radio on
Find a little spot to let go
Get a little good time gone
Cause this is an all nighter
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
Falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter
Yes it is baby
Mmmm Yeah
We are gonna take that sunset
Make it turn the blue sky red
We can worry bout tomorrow
But what you say we live instead
Get a little dirt road dizzy
Let the moon shine on us
Getting all barefoot busy till the sun sneaks back up
Cause we just can't get enough
This is an all nighter
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, starting a fire
This is an all nighter
10 o'clock kiss
12 o'clock cruise
Take another sip, talk until two
This is a never gonna have to say goodbyer
This is an all nighter
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand
Taking a chance, jumping a fence, do it again
All nighter, that's right
A get lost with you running through every red lighter
I'm falling and feeling like a star right out of a midnight skyer
Let the time fly by
Cause it's a finding her hand, taking a chance, starting a fire

ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
I couldn't help but notice 
You were sitting by yourself
Dropping limes in a Corona 
Like you're trying to get over somebody else
It's funny how your story sounds a little like mine
Oh, cause' I've been at a table 
With a bottle peeling labels to pass the time
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But, if we're going to be alone
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner 
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company
We should be alone together
Leaning up against my car door 
Parked outside on the street
Where it's just you and me
We should be alone together
I couldn't help but notice 
You could use another drink
Yeah, I don't wanna leave ya
And it's two for one Tequila so what you think?
We can be blue as a neon light
Singing them sad up songs all night
We can say goodbye, just head home
But, if we're going to be alone
We should be alone together
Kissing over there in the corner 
Where nobody else can see
Keeping each other company

Pick up when you call
Even though it's irresponsible
I wish I had a good excuse
But no matter what I do
I can't even think of one
Yeah, I know history repeats
I'll be right back in your sheets
When it's all said and done
It's against our better judgement, I know

LYRICS:
She was eighteen, all about me, grew up good on the Tennessee river
And her Daddy didn't like me much, yeah that might have been part of the rush
I was twenty one, just a son of a gun rollin' like a stone I was born to run
But I never met a girl like that had me turnin' round coming right back
We were crazy, crazy in love like you've never know,
She said baby don't you ever let me go
We were fast car, top down,
George Straight singin' bare feet,
Slow dance long hair swingin'
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
We were laying by the river when the moon started drippin',
Finally figured out what a boy been missin'
Sinkin' into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreamin',
Man there ain't nothin' like a first time feelin'
Wrapped up there in a blanket, nervous kiss, hands were shakin'
Yeah we knew we were getting into, there was magic underneath that moon,
Driving me crazy, more than she could ever know,
I said baby I ain't ever gonna let ya go
We were fast car, top down,
George Straight singin' bare feet,
Slow dance long hair swingin'
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
We were laying by the river when the moon started drippin',
Finally figured out what a boy been missin'
Sinkin' into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreamin',
Man there ain't nothin' like a first time feelin'
The leaves fell down and the seasons changed,
And that pretty little thing just moved away to Texas
I guess a part of me did too
'Cause I miss her like crazy
She was my baby, take me back, take me back
We were fast car, top down,
George Straight singin' bare feet,
Slow dance long hair swingin'
Under the neon sky, just watching the world go by
We were laying by the river when the moon started drippin',
Finally figured out what a boy been missin'
Sinkin' into those eyes, yeah wrong never felt so right
We were small town, summertime sunset dreamin',

TITLE: Speechless (Remix)
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
You say you'll be down in five
The smell of your perfume
Is floatin' down the stairs
You're fixin' up your hair like you do
I know that I'll be a mess
The second that I see you
You won't be surprised
It happens every time, It's nothin' new
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
I'm speechless
Starin' at you, standin' there, in that dress
What it's doin' to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
It started when you said hello
Just did something to me
And I've been in a daze
Ever since the day that we met
You take the breath out of my lungs
Can't even fight it
And all of the words out of my mouth without even tryin'
And I'm speechless
Starin' at you, standin' there, in that dress
What it's doin' to me, ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
And I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
Yeah, baby
It's always on a night like tonight
I thank God you can read my mind
'Cause when you look at me with those eyes
I'm speechless
You're standin' there in that dress
Girl, it ain't a secret
'Cause watchin' you is all that I can do
Ooh ooh, I'm speechless
You already know that you're my weakness
After all this time I'm just as nervous
Every time you walk into the room
I'm speechless
Oh, you know it baby

I talk to God about you
And I ain't even met you yet
Everybody's waitin' on you here
I can't wait to feel your heart beat
When I lay you on my chest
I'm already holding back my tears
I wanna be the dad that my dad was
I hope that I don't mess this whole thing up
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
'Cause when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
'Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, when I pray for you
I know you're gonna grow up some day
But don't forget to take your time
And take the time to call back home
It ain't always gonna be easy
It ain't always gonna be fair
I know you ain't always gonna need me
But I promise that I'll always be there
I pray you love like your momma
And you forgive just like she does
'Cause when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
'Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you
Oh, when I pray for you
I talk to God about you
When everything around me breaks
I look up and hear him say
Love like your momma
And forgive just like she does
And when this life knocks you down
I hope you get down on your knees
'Cause that's what I do, that's what I do
When I pray for you

Hey girl whatcha think about this, got a really good idea
Four wheel drive for the gas, whatcha think about that?
Forty miles off the map, we can get there real fast
We can just take it slow, let it roll if you wanna
Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know
Hey girl whatcha think about this? I really wanna kiss your lips
Gotta lot more room in the back, whatcha think about that?
Oh yeah let's get a little closer, lean in and I'll take over
We can just take it slow, let it roll if you wanna
Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right
Out here in the wide open
Let yourself let go somewhere only we know baby
Let it go baby, let it go
We can rock this thing 'til the morning,
I think we got a really good thing going
Whatcha think about that?
You know what I think about that
Kick back, move in on the down low
Where your sun tan lights up when the stars go
Write your name on the fogged up window
Throw your feet on the dash, girl you know I'm cool with that
And it's Tom Petty Free Fall by midnight
Turn it off, turn you on when it feels right

Too many people in this bar
I can't hear myself think over the guitar
I can tell that you wanna get out of here and disappear, don't ya, baby?
Too many lights on in the street
I can see the way that you're looking at me
And the way you're slipping off your Jimmy Choo's, 
Like you wanted to since we got here
Now we're driving down the highway, pulling into my place
Got your hand over my knee
Now that we're alone
I'm gonna let you know everything you mean to me
There's no such thing as too much money
'Cause if I had it all I would spend it on you, honey
Time on your hands baby I can take it off ya, 
Let me take it off ya
'Cause I'm love drunk
Sipping on your kiss a little too much, and I can't get enough
Like too much shine in a diamond ring, there's no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing
There ain't no such thing, yeah
And just in case you didn't know
There ain't a second that I don't want to hold your body on my body
You know it drives me crazy, don't ya, baby?

Is it just me or did the world stop spinning?
I swear I felt it slowing down for a minute
I know it sounds crazy
But looking at you, baby
With your summer hair that's falling down in slow motion
Your body's swaying like the waves in the ocean
I know, that you're thinking, exactly what I'm thinking
If I could go anywhere
I wouldn't go anywhere
I'm already there
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend
Girl, we don't need a white sand beach
When your lips get to kissing on me
It already feels like paradise
We'll take it nice and slow tonight
Loving on island time
Ain't gotta worry about a beach bar closing
I gotta bottle of tequila we can open right here
I'm just saying, it's we're on vacation
Girl, we ain't gotta leave this room
To make it feel like a honeymoon
Don't need copper-tone on your skin
When my hands can still pretend

Oh, babe
Yeah
When your friends are around
And you kiss me in front of everybody
You know it drives me crazy, girl
So, come and lay one on my lips, girl
Just do it to me
You know it
I'm so obsessed
You're never gettin' rid of me baby
Never gettin' rid of me baby
You know it
You know
You're never gettin' rid of me baby
Never gettin' rid of me baby
Break it down for me baby
Girl, you know you're driving me crazy
I can't get enough
I think you're feeling me too, baby
So lay me down, show me right
Do me good
Let's turn out these lights baby
I'm so obsessed
With the way that you walk into the room, baby
I can't even take it
You know, you know you do
I guess what I'm trying to say is
I'm so obsessed

TITLE: Only Us
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you 
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should 
You don't have to convince me 
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
I don't need you to sell me on reasons to want you
I don't need you to search for the proof that I should
You don't have to convince me
You don't have to be scared you're not enough
'Cause what we've got going is good
I don't need more reminders of all that's been broken
I don't need you to fix what I'd rather forget
Clear the slate and start over
Try to quiet the noise that's in your head
We can't compete with all that
So what if it's us, what if it's us
And only us?
And what came before, won't count anymore, or matter
Can try that?
What if it's you, what if it's me
What if that's all that we needed to be?
And the rest of the world falls away
What do you say?
I never thought there'd be someone like you who would want me
So I give you ten thousand reasons to not let me go
But if you really see me
If you like me for me and nothing else
Well, that's all that I've wanted 
For longer than you could possibly know
So it can be us, it can be us
And only us
And what came before, won't count anymore, or matter
We can try that
It's not so impossible
Nobody else but the two of us here
'Cause you're saying it's possible
We can just watch the whole world disappear
'Til you're the only one I still know how to see
It's just you and me
It'll be us, it'll be us and only us
And what came before won't count anymore
We can try that, you and me
That's all that we needed to be
And the rest of the world falls away
And the rest of the world falls away
The world falls away, the world falls away
And it's only us

TITLE: My Side Of The Fence
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
These fancy things in magazines
Diamond rings and beauty queens
But nothing seems to sparkle like you do
These fancy cigars and caviar
Expensive cars and movie stars
But everything I need is in this room
Oh, and I've seen the lights from New York to Vegas
And I've tasted wine from Venice to Paris
And I've seen the sights
Nothing comparin' to you
So I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holding you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence
If I ever win the lottery
It wouldn't mean a lot to me
'cause I already got you to hold my hand
And if a genie gave me a million wishes
I'd spend them all on all your kisses
And save just one to stay right where I am
So I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holding you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence
You're the rain on the roof in the summer
You're the leaves in the fall changing color
You're the whisper I hear in the thunder
On my side of the fence
You're the reason my heart's beating faster
You're the tears falling down from the laughter
You're the only one I'm after
So I ain't looking over fences trying to find a better view
My search for all that ended when I first laid eyes on you
And the grass is always greener
'Cause the sun shines when you smile
And when I'm holding you the world makes sense
Baby, when I'm holding you the world makes sense
On my side of the fence
You know it does, baby
On my side of the fence

TITLE: Already Ready
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
Got a call from a friend
Said "you should come over
All your friends are already over"
Took you 20 minutes just to find a dress
You like the dress, you say yes
Green, red, yellow, blue
Yeah, they're all just right on you
Don't worry, you look beautiful
Hair up, hair down
Another 20 minutes to get out the house
Call a cab and we jump in it
Finally walk in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes that you like so much
Everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you
I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go
Wall to wall
Way too many people
The noise, the crowd
I don't even see 'em
Cause I'm talking to you, you're talking to me
I'm not tryin' to be antisocial
Everybody's probably wondering why
We're standing in the corner all alone
Girl, you're so beautiful, yeah
You look good in the lights, but I wanna see you in the dark
Kiss your lips, it's only been a minute since
We walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you
I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go
We're halfway out the door
I can't wait anymore
Yeah, I know we just walked in
I'm already thinking 'bout leavin'
Gotta get you back in my shirt
Get you out that dress
Get you out those shoes you like so much
And everybody at the party is checking your body out
I don't even mind it cause you're coming with me, girl
And I know it's only 7:32 but looking at you
I'm already ready to go
I'm already ready, are you ready?
Cause I'm ready to go, go
Ready to go

TITLE: What You Do To Me
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
I said "Girl, you're beautiful, 'n' you already know it,
But I'll say it again and a million times after that"
You laugh and you shake your head and say "Boy, you're crazy"
Well, girl, if I'm crazy, I'm only crazy 'bout you
I was lookin' right into your eyes, right then, porch light
Flipped on and I saw your dad lookin' through the window
Hope he ain't mad
Then I helped you outta my truck, through the yard to your front door
Said "Girl, am I gonna see you again?" You answered me back with a kiss
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun,
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round, got my head spinnin' round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
I picked you up for our second date, you're sure lookin' pretty
Sweet as an angel, here to save my soul
Mmm, yea, you get me high, you take me to heaven
And I get to shakin' when you put your lips on mine
It could be the best night of my life, least 'til next time
Oh yea, gotta get this right, follow all the rules and be back by 9
Pulled up to drop you off, leanin' in to sneak one more
Said "Baby, when can I see you again? How 'bout every night after this?"
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun,
But I called my dad and said "She's the one"
Said "Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name"
Like a merry-go-round, got my head spinnin' round and round and round
That's just what you do, do, do, do, do, do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do, do, do, do, do to me
Yea, that's just what you do
I drive away from your house, chasin' butterflies out
Girl, I don't know how you do it
Roll the radio down, say "I love you" out loud
Man, I think I'm 'bout to lose it
Ain't my thing to jump the gun,

Said "Boy, better get that ring, if you really wanna change her name"

TITLE: I Heard Goodbye
ARTIST: Dan + Shay
LYRICS:
I could tell by the way you kissed my lips that day
There was something missing, something not the same
You were there, but you weren't, didn't care, didn't hurt at all
Said it was what it was, then the feeling of us was gone
I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you'd stay
And I told myself that it'd be fine
I wish I could have just said somethin oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye
It was way too easy to say those words you said
And the look on your face, I could tell there was nothin left
Almost wished we were fightin', screamin', and cryin', but
Not a drop of a tear, didn't know how to feel, I was numb
When I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you'd stay
And I told myself that it'd be fine
I wish I could have just said somethin oh
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye
I could try to hold on if I thought I could change your mind
But I don't think I can when I feel like I feel tonight
I watched you fade away
But I turned my head and closed my eyes
And prayed you'd stay
And I told myself that it'd be fine
I wish I could have just said somethin oh
When you said you needed time
When you said you needed time
I heard goodbye
Goodbye

TITLE: Problems At Home
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Fires are burning, up the forests
Down along the Amazon
There's children starving in Guatemala
They're just barely hanging on
And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And lord while your listen
Could I mention
Some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home
A teenage boy in Mississippi
Brings his daddy's gun to school
A little girl in New York City
Buys cocaine for momma to use
And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
And lord while your listen
Could I mention
Some troubles of my own
I got problems right here at home
My wife is crying
Our baby's fighting
A battle she may not win
The doctors doing
All that he can
God now it's all in your hands
And I pray they'll find the answer
That there's a way to right the wrong
Now I'm just one man a grain of sand
In a troubled world I know
But I've got a problem
Right her at home
I've got a problem

TITLE: Got The T-Shirt
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
If my heart was, just a destination
She had herself one hell of a vacation
If my kiss was, just the main attraction
She wore it out like it was going out of fashion
If my touch was just some kind of ride
Then she loved that roller-coaster
I guess she, came down from that high
When it was over, it was over
She did what she came to do
Saw what she came to see
Took a good look around
Made her some memories
Never been there before
She crossed it off the map
Pedal down to the floor
Now she ain't comin' back
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow
That's the last I'll see of her
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow
She's been there, got the t-shirt
I wonder if she'll, just throw it in a closet
Or keep it out and, tell her friends just how she got it
I wonder if she's sleeping in it, dreaming in it
Wonder if she knows what she did to me in it
She did what she came to do
Saw what she came to see
Took a good look around
Made her some memories
Never been there before
She crossed it off the map
Pedal down to the floor
Now she ain't comin' back
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow
That's the last I'll see of her
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow
She's been there, got the t-shirt
With Stones on the front
Tour dates on the back
Took it when she left
Took a lot more than that
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow
She did what she came to do
Saw what she came to see
Took a good look around
Made her some memories
Never been there before
She crossed it off the map
Pedal down to the floor
Now she ain't comin' back
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow
That's the last I'll see of her
Whoa oh wow, whoa oh wow

TITLE: Playboys Of The Southwestern World
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
John Roy was a boy I knew
Since he was 3 and I was two
Grew up two little houses down from me
The only bad apples on our family tree
Kinda ripened and rottened in our puberty
Two kindred spirits bound by destiny
Well now I was smart but I lacked ambition
Johnny was wild with no inhibition
Was about like mixin' fire and gasoline
And he'd say
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Long around our tenth year
We found two airplane tickets to the hell outta here
Got scholarships to some small town school in Texas
We learned to drink Sangrias 'til the dawn's early light
Eat eggs Ranchero's and throw up all night
And tell those daddy's girls we were majorin' in the rodeo
Aw but my favorite memory of school that fall
Was the night John Roy came runnin' down in the hall
Wearin' nothing but cowboy boots and a big sombrero
And he was yellin'
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
And I say we had a little change in plans
Like when Paul McCartney got busted in Japan
And I said we got waylaid when we set foot on Mexican soil
You see the borderman guard with a fu manchu mustach
Kinda stumbled on John's pocketful of American cash
He said "doin' a little funny business in Mexico Amigo"
But all I could think about was savin' my own tail
When he metioned 10 years in a Mexican jail
So I pointed at John Roy and said
It's all his, now please let me go, I mean it was your idea genius
I was just layin' there in bed, when you said
Hey Romeo, let's go down to Mexico
Chase senoritas drink ourselves silly
Show them Mexican girls a couple real hillbillies
Got a pocket full of cash and that old Ford truck
Fuzzy cat hangin' from the mirror for luck
Said don't you know all those little brown-eyed girls
Want playboys of the southwestern world
Ah we're still best friends
Temporary cell mates
Whoo

When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters

But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell that's a class I got an f in
But now I understand perfectly
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S-O-B in sober

She put the low in blow
She put a big F-U in my future
Yeah she's got a way
She's got a way with words

Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now

He meets her at the front door
He can tell she's had a hard day at work

And he's sure been wantin' her
He touches her with tenderness
Takes her in his arms and takes it slow
What a shame, she can't get that at home
What a shame, she can't get that at home
There's nothing back there but a lonely house
And love ain't all about wood and stone
He satisfies all her needs and wants
What a shame, she can't get that at home
After the lovin'
They lie there and talk for a while
She loves how he listens
And he sure loves to see her smile
He wants to keep her
But he loves her enough to let her go
What a shame, she can't, get that at home
What a shame, she can't get that at home
Theres nothing back there but a lonely house
And love ain't all about wood and stone

String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Wreckin' ball dancin' down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front
Your skin is begging to be kissed by a little more than the sun
You take my hand in yours, you lean in and
Your lips taste like sangria
Your lips taste like sangria
Only thing I wanna do tonight
Is drink you like a Spanish wine
Let you let this head of mine keep spinning, spinning around
We're buzzing like that no vacancy sign out front

And right now I'm just working on a big buzz
Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds
Speaking of buds, who's got a light?
Gonna probably take all night and I'll be right here
Chilling like a villain on my redwood deck
You ain't seen nothing yet
I'll be getting on my order, until further notice

Mm, baby girl when you get a few in you
Don't you know that you tend to get a little wild
(Get a little wild, get a little wild child, get a little wild)
When you're shooting that fireball whiskey
Get to getting all fireball frisky, you a hot little jockey
Nothing rocks me like you rocking me on a big buzz
Picking off them floaters from the ice tub
Sipping them suds and hanging with my buds

I've got a home-grown girl I love
And when the summer time hits, we skinny dip in the stream
I was green before green was a thing
I was green before green was a thing
Oh, yeah

TITLE: Honey Bee
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Girl, I been thinkin' 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
But these feelings pilin' up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me
But I'll do my best
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smilin' honey right back at me
Now hold on 'cause I ain't done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just havin' fun, but seriously
If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do
But fall in each others arms
I coulda said I love you
Coulda wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do
Is speak right from the heart
If you'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee
You'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi
You'll be my Little Loretta
I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
And I'll be your honey bee
I'll be your honey bee

TITLE: Hey
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Hey
Hey, hey, I'm out here baling hay
And all my friends are cruising 'round town
Checking out the pretty girls
Hey, and what'd they say
They say, "Hey, hey
Park out, dear, come out and play
Kick ou, tire, wipe my perspire
'Cause my whole life was hey
Growing like weed, stick out your teeth
Playing underneath the Baby Jesus
Blowing out the truck
Heading down the highway
Looking pretty soft up in the loft
Come on, baby, kick your cowgirls off
I'm picking you up after I draw my pay
And we'll be rolling in the hay
Hey, hey, Ford, Dodge, Chevrolet
Different strokes for different folks
A little fellow walks up in a pink beret
He says "Hey", "Well hey"
Hell, that's okay
Turn the guitars up and raise 'em cups
Hell, my whole life is hey
Growing like weed, stick out your teeth
Playing underneath the Baby Jesus
Blowing out the truck
Heading down the highway
Looking pretty soft up in the loft
Come on, baby, kick your cowgirls off
I'm picking you up after I get my pay
And we'll be rolling in the hay
Put it on a flat bed and go for a ride
Under the moonlight, you by my side
Give it to the cow, make it go moo
Coo-coo-ca-choo, kick it off your shoes
Break a camel's back, Jack
Then you put it in a stack, yeah
Growing like weed, stick out your teeth
Playing underneath the Baby Jesus
Blowing out the truck
Heading down the highway
Looking pretty soft up in the loft
Come on, baby, kick your cowgirls off
I'm picking you up after I get my pay
We'll be rolling in the hay
My whole life is a hey...
Rolling in the hay
Hey

TITLE: I Lived It
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found the hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Momma poured grease in a Chrisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand where
The yellow jacket's torn me up
And I ain't making this up
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them old Duke boys, they're flattening their heels
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawnmower 'round
I go back there right now
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

TITLE: Same Old Song
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Now I love country music
And I guess I always will
But these days, when I turn on the radio
It's just not the same thrill
I like a song that gives me chill bumps
Now and then there's some that still do
But I'm fed up with the same old vanilla
Hey, how about you?
I'm tired of the same old guy
With the same old song
'Bout the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Hey there, Mr. Songwriter
Come and visit in my home
Then tell me about life being perfect
And love that goes on and on and on
Then ride with me in my old Bronco
Down to the factory for eight hours
Then let me introduce you to my supervisor
Then write me a song about sunshine and flowers
And the same old guy
With the same old song
'Bout the same old love
It goes on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
I want to hear a song about passion
I want to hear a song about sin
I want to hear a song about redemption
Yeah, sing me one of them
Tell me about a cowboy in Australia
Tell me about a prisoner in China
Tell me about some old stock car driver
Down in Orangeburg, South Carolina
Instead of he same old guy
With the same old song
'Bout the same old love
It goes on and on and on
Same old guitar
And the same old strum
I may be country but I'm not dumb
Same old
Same old
Same old

TITLE: That Thing We Do
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Get up, put your clothes on, baby
Come on, let's do something crazy
Take a midnight drive down
An old dirt road
I wanna see your bare feet on my dash
The night wind blowing your hair back
Slide across that seat
And sit real close
Baby, let's go!
Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll kick 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We'll take some blankets and we'll make a spread
I'll tuck you into my pick-up bed
We'll watch the country stars
Puttin' on a show
I want to see your bare skin in the moonlight
Kiss your lips, girl, and hold you all night
Make a lot of love
And make it real slow
Baby, let's go!
Snuggled up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
We've been runnin' 'round doin' this and that
It's time we got back to what we're good at
Snugglin' up in my truck
Windows down, radio up
Just you and me, nothing between us
But jeans and with a little luck
We'll shuck 'em off before the night is through
And we'll be doin' that thing we do
Yeah, we'll be doin' that thing we do

TITLE: The Baby
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
My brother said that I was rotten to the core
I was the youngest child, so I got by with more
I guess she was tired by the time I came along
She'd laugh until she cried, I could do no wrong
She would always save me because I was her baby
I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou
I drove a truck in Birmingham, turned 21 in Cincinnati
I called home to mom and daddy, I said your boy is now a man
She said I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby
She loved that photograph of our whole family
She'd always point us out for all her friends to see
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job
Ronnie with his two kids, how 'bout that wife he's got
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby
I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisiana
And come as fast as you can fly
'Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you
She might not make it through the night
The whole way I drove 80, so she could see her baby
She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin'
By the time that I got to her side
And I knew that she'd been taken and my heart it was breakin'
I never got to say goodbye
I softly kissed that lady and cried just like a baby

Just a bunch of poor boys, daddy's girls
Children of the corn field
Tryna turn a shift job into a dollar bill
We wear them muddy boots
Stay true to how we're raised
Ain't nothin' bout us fake
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies
From the country, yes sir
You know we're straight out of that long week work
At night, everybody wanna party
All night long, bonfire on the back 40
In the middle of nowhere, ain't nobody leavin' here
Til we're straight out of cold beer, straight out of cold beer
Just a bunch of John Deere junkies
Gettin' funky to some old Hank
Nothin' been stuck in the mud that we can't
Hook up to a rusty chain in the summer or in the rain
Yeah, it's a kind of thing
You know we're straight out of that dirty south
Dirty roads, nobody got no money
Got them shined up pickup trucks
Whistlin' at them honies

You know we're straight out of that long week work

TITLE: The Dreamer

LYRICS:
Funny thing about dreamers 
When the dream is in their sights 
Just to get where they're going 
They leave a lot of good things behind
Funny thing about dreamers
When the dream is in their sights
Just to get where they're going
They leave a lot of good things behind
Guess you could call me a dreamer
I've seen it all come true
So I smile when I need to look happy
Do all the things they tell me to
I'm a big self-made man
And a fool who can't understand
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
If I could only make the future
An extension of my past
I'd take these broken memories
And make those moments last
Now that my ship has come
I wonder what have I done
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
I thought I needed fortune
I thought I needed fame
But all I need is to hear you
Whisper my name
Whisper, baby

TITLE: Some Beach
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Drivin' down the interstate
Runnin' thirty minutes late
Singin' Margaritaville and mindin' my own
Some foreign car drivin' dude with a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talking on his cell phone
He started yellin' at me like I did somethin' wrong
He flipped me the bird and then he was gone
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growin' and warm breezes blowin'
I picture myself right there
On some beach 
Somewhere
I circled the parkin' lot tryin' to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was gettin' into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
But from out of no where a Mercedes Benz
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in
Some beach
Somewhere
There's no where to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot Señoritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach
Somewhere
Well, I sat in that waitin' room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said doc's ready for you
You're not gonna feel a thing we'll give you some Novocaine
That tooth'll be fine in a minute or two
Then he stuck that needle down deep in my gum
And he started drillin' before I was numb
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burnin' up the atmosphere
There's music and dancin' and lovers romancin'
In the salty evenin' air
On some beach
Somewhere
On some beach
Somewhere

TITLE: Come Back As A Country Boy
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
When I die, I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be
My back is always breakin', my dogs are always barkin'
My money has trouble makin', and my truck has trouble startin'
I'm up before the sun, either haulin' hay or huntin'
My work ain't ever done but son, I wouldn't trade it for nothin'
So when I die, I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy is all that I know how to be
Yeah, if y'all ain't in my drawl, and a fish ain't on my wall
And the whiskey don't burn goin' down
My feet ain't in a holler, and blue ain't on my collar
Leave my Hank-crankin', beer-drinkin' ass in the ground
Yeah, when I die, I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be
When I die, I wanna come back as a country boy
Live on this land, like my old man did before me
I don't wanna be born into money
Where the boots don't ever get muddy
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be
When I die, I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy is all that I know how to be
Yeah, a country boy is all that I know how to be

Cat Diesel Power cap pulled down low
Makin that bacon, row by row
Can't get them muscles at the YMCA
It's from choppin' cotton, cuttin' corn and slingin' that hay
Been heavy liftin' since the crack of dawn
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those work boots on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He wears an old felt hat on his head
Got a saddle for a pillow, and the ground for a bed
Spurs on his heels, reins in his hands
Drivin' cattle, ropin' steers and burnin' his brand
There ain't no lettin' up all day long
No doubt about it that boy's country strong
He's up in the mornin' yawnin' with those Tony Llama's on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in his blood, backwoods in his bones
No doubt about it that boy's country strong, yep'
Yea behind every good man, there's a woman
She's the one thing that keeps him goin', keeps him goin'
She's up in the mornin' yawnin' with that coffee pot on
Workin' like hell 'til the dinner bell brings him back home
Blue collar in her blood, backwoods in her bones
No doubt about it that girl's country strong
Cowboy's, plowboys, good hearted women
They're all country strong

Baby's kicked back in the front seat

For a different life

I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right
Home sweet home
Where a little bit goes long way
And we shut her down on sundays
I won't ever get too far away
From home sweet home
Pull down to the cane bridge
Park in the ditch
Folks and poles are lined up
A little kid holds a stringer up
Got a mess of fish
I drive away with a smile on my face
Knowing that this place is blessed
By God's amazing grace
Home sweet home
I thank my lucky stars at night
I was raised down here and raised up right
And my pride, you've got that right

She likes it when I call in sick to work
Spend the whole day hangin' with her
I might get fired but that's alright
I'm doin' what she likes
She likes it when I bring home fresh fajitas
And mix up a pitcher of margaritas
Catch a kind of buzz that lasts all night
Doin' what she likes
She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes
Like runnin' my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' 'em burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes
She likes it when I get past second gear
Sees gravel flyin' in the rear view mirror
Sometimes I'm pushin' ninety five
Doin' what she likes
And she likes it when I find a road that's dark
Can we pull off somewhere and park?
Turn the radio on and turn off the lights
Keep doin' what she likes
She likes hearin' how good she looks in them blue jeans
Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my
I like doin' what she likes
Like runnin' my fingers through her long hair
Lightin' watermelon candles upstairs
Lettin' 'em burn and holdin' her all night
I like doin' what she likes
She likes it when I sing her old silly songs
And throw in words where they don't belong
Sometimes we laugh 'til we almost cry
Doin' what she likes

Little kisses, sweeter than sweet tea
Things I whispered in her ear, oh my

TITLE: Kiss My Country Ass
ARTIST: Blake Shelton

Tearin' down a dirt road, rebel flag flyin'
Coon dog in the back
Truck bed loaded down with beer
And a cold one in my lap
Earnhardt sticker behind my head
And my woman by my side
Tail-pipe's poppin'
The radio's rockin' "Country Boy Can Survive"
If you got a problem with that, ha, ha
You can kiss my country ass
Well, I love turkey calls, overalls, Wrangler jeans
Smoke nothin' but Marlboro Reds
Tattoos up and down my arms
And deer heads over my bed
Well my granddaddy fought in World War II
But my daddy went to Vietnam
And I ain't scared to grab my gun
And fight for my homeland
If you don't love the American flag
Well, you can kiss my country ass
If you're a down-home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up, and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass
Aw, yeah
Aw, yeah
Well, there's a whole lotta high-class people out there
That's a-lookin' down on me
'Cause the country club where I belong
Is a honky tonk till three in the mornin'
Don't wear no fancy clothes, no ties or three piece suits
You can find me in my camouflage cap
My T-shirt and cowboy boots
If that don't fit your social class
You can kiss my country ass
If you're a down-home, backwoods redneck
Hey come on, stand up, and raise your glass
But if you ain't down with my outlaw crowd
You can kiss my country ass
Well, I'm a front-porch sittin', guitar pickin'
Moonshine sippin'
Backer chew spittin' country boy from the woods
And I love fried chicken and blue gill fishin'
And outlaw women, and I wouldn't change if I could, no
I ain't tryin' to start no fight, but I'll finish one every time
So you just mind your own damn business
Stay the hell outta mine
If you got a problem with that
Well, you can kiss my country ass
I said, if you got a problem with any of that
You can kiss my natural born
Redneck to the bone
Ever lovin' country ass
That's right

TITLE: She Doesn't Know She's Got It
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
On Friday night when I see her out
Even in a crowd she's hard to miss
There ain't a man breathing air
Who wouldn't stop and stare
And the best part is
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad we want it
She doesn't know she's got it
And that's what's a gettin' to me
She'll close her eyes when the music plays
And the way she sways
Really rocks the room
She doesn't mean to get things stirred
It's just a thing in her that was born to move
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
Oh, and that's what's a gettin' to me
I'm gonna work my courage up
Tell her I'm in love
I'm in love a lot
She has my heart on a string
Like everything the girl has got
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
Oh, and that's what's a gettin' to me
She doesn't know she's got it
She doesn't know how bad I want it
She doesn't know she's got it
Oh, and that's what's a gettin' to me, yea

TITLE: Nobody But Me
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Don't have to leave this town to see the world
'Cause it's something that I gotta do
I don't wanna look back in 30 years
And wonder who you're married to
Wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
When you love someone, they say you set 'em free
But that ain't gonna work for me
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
All the wasted days, all the wasted nights
I blame it all on being young
Got no regrets, 'cause they got me here
But I don't wanna waste another one
I been thinkin' about what I want in my life
It begins and ends the same
If I had to choose what I couldn't lose
There'd only be one thing
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you
Looking in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
I don't wanna live without you (I don't wanna live)
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me (Next to me)
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody)
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I don't wanna love nobody (You)

Come on
She don't need no sunny day
She gonna light the world up either way
She don't need to turn every head
Now she just doin' what she does best
Yeah, she just smilin' that smile that her momma gave her
Swingin' those hips, she sure is makin'
Those blue jeans talk and the boys all fight
The one you want with you on a Saturday night
Bendin' those words like the Mississippi River
Wherever she's goin', man I wanna go with her
Shinin' so bright, make the midnight stars jealous
Heaven help us all, the girl can't help it
Now the girl can't help it
Now she can't help she likes cherry red
Now she can't help it if she still looks pretty
With her hair all a mess
She don't know what all the fuss is about
She don't mean to be the talk of this town
Now she just smilin' that smile that her momma gave her
Swingin' those hips, she sure is makin'
Those blue jeans talk and the boys all fight
The one you want with you on a Saturday night
Bendin' those words like the Mississippi River
Wherever she's goin', man I wanna go with her
Shinin' so bright, make the midnight stars jealous
Heaven help us all, the girl can't help it
Now the girl can't help it
If God had just one ace, I think he dealt it
Ain't nothin' not to love, the girl can't help it
Yeah she just smilin' that smile that her momma gave her
Swingin' those hips, she sure is makin'
Those blue jeans talk and the boys all fight
The one you want with you on a Saturday night

TITLE: Every Time I Hear That Song
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
There's something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh I still think about you
There's a soundtrack in my mind
That takes me back in time
When I hear that melody
I think about you and me
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
Oh, I still think about you
I still think about you

There's a soundtrack in my mind

TITLE: That's What I Call Home
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There's a house that's a little run down
This city ain't never found
It's miles and miles from a paved road
That's where we grew up
Seven children raised on love
When life gets hard that's where we go
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home
Daddy built it with his own two hands
Overlooking his grandpa's land
Now through the years a lot has changed
But driving up this gravel road
I get that feeling in my soul
I thank God some things still remain
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home
Once I get myself through that old screen door
The world can't touch me anymore
Daddy don't know a stranger
A handshake and he's your friend
Oh and Mama she's an angel
She'll hold you tight till the heartache ends
Just a place made of nails and wood
But it's the love that makes you feel so good
That's what I call
That's what I call home
That's what I call home
That's what I call home

TITLE: Friends
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There's a moment in this journey that I gave up
My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver lining
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
Oh, but when I saw you standing in the corner
I'da never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightening
Threw some punches then we had a laugh
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
Who'da thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standing side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
Yeah, here we go
Hey, hey you and me
Different as different can be
You like to rock, I like to roll
You take the high and I'll take the low
Woah, woah-oh, woah, woah-oh
Just some roughed up desperadoes
Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends
I can see that you and me are gonna be friends, yeah

TITLE: Happy Anywhere
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I've always been a rolling stone
With a reckless streak
Yeah, the grass never gets too grown
Underneath my feet
The city lights, southern stars
No such thing as gone too far
I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you
Yeah, the beauty of the Northern Lights
And my mind is faded
The blue sky over Telluride
Next to you's kinda overrated
The winding road, let it twist
My home's wherever your heart is
I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you
So girl, I hope you know
Wherever you go, I go, I know
I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any map dot location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

And lights are on display
There's a big ol' tree for all to see
Where the children run and play
I look out through my window
Somethin' just don't seem right
'Til I said, hello and heard her voice
On the other end of the line
Now, it's Christmas, Christmas
I'm hurryin' on my way
Christmas, Christmas
Like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no Jingle Bells
Just the ringing of the phone
Mama just called and said it's time
For me come on home
The pies are in the oven
You can almost taste the air
And it warms my heart to feel her love
And know how much she cares
It's funny how going back
Can get you back where you belong
It's the difference in just a melody
And my favorite Christmas song
Now, it's Christmas, Christmas
I'm hurryin' on my way
Christmas, Christmas
Like I'm riding in a one horse sleigh
Well, I don't have to hear no Jingle Bells
Just the ringing of the phone
Mama just called and said, "It's time
For you to come home"
Mama just called and said, "It's time

Going down to Puerto Rico in a bottle of rum
Going out to Honolulu in a Mai Tai mug
Then I'm coming back home to Georgia in a jug
We'll never ride that bus to Mexico City, it's a pity
We'll never sail our ship into Ol' San Juan
You'll never walk with me on the beach at Waikiki
And we'll never share that brick suburban home
Today I'm taking that money out of the jar
Tonight I'll buy my ticket, down at the corner bar

I can't have this conversation
Without lots of reservations on the line
If there's a way to slip around it
Then I'm bound to get around it one more time 
Honey you are so persuasive 
But it makes me more evasive when you pry
You can label me elusive
But the facts are inconclusive at this time
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind
I've got roses growing over what you'd find
But keep on asking if you're inclined
'Cause you can't handle what's on my mind 
I don't mean to drive you crazy
Comin' off all vague and hazy just because
I don't have an answer for you
I just wouldn't want to bore you if it does
But keep on asking if you're inclined
But, you can't handle what's on my mind
No, you can't handle what's on my mind.

Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back

I might be the guy with an ice cold can, stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that
I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl, no
It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl
The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gonna let her, never gonna let her go

With a big red coat of paint
But good thing I had a good raisin'
For all the hell I've raised since then
When that roll is called up yonder
I know they've gonna let me in
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And He ain't letting go, He ain't letting go
The devil reaches out, but he can't grab hold
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And He ain't letting go, He ain't letting go
Might have a little rust on my halo
But when I'm gone I know where I'll go
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
Now I've been a little more cold beer
Than holy water, it's true
More Saturday night on an old bar stool
Than a Sunday morning pew
But even old Hank Williams
Finally, saw the light
And, oh hallelujah, I have too
And it ain't just the neon kind
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And He ain't letting go, He ain't letting go
The devil reaches out, but he can't grab hold
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And He ain't letting go, He ain't letting go
Might have a little rust on my halo
But when I'm gone I know where I'll go
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul, yeah
Jesus got a tight grip on my soul, yeah
Whoa, I got a long, long way to go
Whoa, but I'm gonna get there I know
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And He ain't letting go, He ain't letting go
The devil reaches out, but he can't grab hold
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
And He ain't letting go, He ain't letting go
Might have a little rust on my halo
But when I'm gone I know where I'll go
'Cause Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
Jesus got a tight grip on my soul
Yeah He does, and He ain't letting go

Baby, baby, baby 
He's got you cryin' again 
Baby, baby, baby 
He's got you cryin' again
Baby, baby, baby
He's got you cryin' again
Baby, baby, baby
He's got you cryin' again
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
I know that he loves you
Looks like he'd show it now and then
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
He kicks off his shoes, throws down this coat
Opens a beer, grabs the remote
You're never heard, you're seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby, baby, baby
Why don't you just get rid of him?
(Tell him to go)
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
(That's right)
He makes you cry, I'll make you laugh
He rubs you wrong, I'll rub your back
You're never heard, you're seldom seen
A joker don't deserve a queen
Baby, baby, baby
Why don't you just get rid of him?
(Bye Bubba)
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
He's a good old boy but he's a bad old boyfriend
Good old boy, bad old boyfriend

TITLE: Hell Right
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Hey
Yeah?
Tell 'em that story you were tellin' me
Couple boys clock out by 5:35
Tryna put a little hammer in their head
Standin' in the liquor store, starin' at a fifth
But they picked up a handle instead
Hell right (hell right)
Hell right (okay)
Couple girls with their boots on got their Bluetooth on
T-shirts sayin', "Go Sooners"
Then the girl from the small town took off the "Old Town"
Put on a little Hank Jr. (Thank God)
Hell right
She got all her rowdy friends comin' over tonight
Hell right, hell right
Everybody's throwin' down on Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right (hell right)
Hell right (hell right)
Hell right
There's a guitar on the ground that was makin' some sound
'Til somebody pulled a hillbilly slip
Now there's fog on the window, she never would've kissed him
If he didn't play a lick like this
Hell right
Hell right
Hell right (hell right), hell right (hell right)
Everybody's throwin' down on Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right (hell right)
Hell right (hell right)
Hell right
Now it's 7a.m
Damn if there ain't an empty handle on a square hay bale
Everybody's passed out drunk, but when they wake up
They're all gonna hurt like hell right
Yeah, boy
Hell right, hell right
Everybody's throwin' down on a Friday night
Somewhere in America
There's a bottle to burn and a fire to light
And you ain't done nothin' if you did it half way
If you gonna raise hell, then you better damn raise
Hell right, hell right, hell right

TITLE: I Drink
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
He'd get home at five-thirty 
Fix a drink and sit down in his chair 
Pick a fight with momma 
Complain about the kids gettin' in his hair
He'd get home at five-thirty
Fix a drink and sit down in his chair
Pick a fight with momma
Complain about the kids gettin' in his hair
At night he'd sit alone and smoke
I'd see his frown behind the lighters flame
Now that same frowns in my mirror
I got my daddy's blood inside my veins.
Fish swims birds fly
Daddys' yell, mommas' cry
Old men sit and think
I Drink.
Chicken TV dinner
Six minutes on defrost three on high
Beer to wash it down then another
Some whiskey on the side
It's not so bad alone here
It don't bother me that every nights the same
I don't need another lover hangin' around
Tryin' to make me change.
Fish swim, birds fly
Lovers leave, by and by
Old men sit and think
I Drink.
I know, what I am
But I don't, give a damn.
Fish swim, birds fly
Daddys' yell, mommas' cry
Old men sit and think
I Drink.
I Drink.

Dig a way down in your heart

LYRICS:
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in new Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearing those boots and jeans
When Memphis ain't got the blues
That's when I'll stop loving you
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in new Orleans
Baby, I don't mind you asking
If there's gonna come a day when I say goodbye
Maybe, I guess anything could happen
But it's as close to never
As you're ever gonna find
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
And them boys from Amarillo stop wearing those boots and jeans
When there's no tequila in Mexico
That's when I'm gonna let you go
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
Darling, some things won't ever change
My love is one of those things
When New York is a one horse town
That's when I won't need you 'round
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans
When it's sunny in Seattle and it's snowing down in New Orleans

TITLE: I Found Someone
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I picked up the phone
She said hey it's me
I know it feels like forever since I've heard your voice
But I guess that's how it had to be
So we talked awhile
'Til she said I better go
But before we hung up she said
There's something you need to know
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
Even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
And you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone
Well I wasn't surprised
Still it hit me kinda hard
It's hard to believe a little space and time
Could turn into miles and worlds apart
I said I'm happy for you
You deserve the very best
Since you've been gone I've done some praying
Some searching for myself
And I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And even though I'm moving on
It don't mean that I don't still love you
And you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
I found someone
But it took tears and time down on my knees
And it's not who you'd ever guess
Or who I dreamed it'd be
But in the mirror one morning looking back at me
I found someone
It just happened outta the blue
And it took everything I had
It took me losing you
But you'll always have
A place here in my heart
But somewhere in this new life I've begun
Looking for my place under the sun
I found someone

TITLE: I Don't Care
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There she was 
Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with the new guy 
And I'd heard about him 
I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
There she was
Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with the new guy
And I'd heard about him
I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered-
I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind
I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again for a second there
That I don't care
Almost 10:00
Should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in
Knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh, but I just kept on driving back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way when-
I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind
I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again for a second there
That I don't care
I got home, the light was blinkin' on that old machine
She said, "My brother's been in town, but he just left"
And I miss you, give me a ring
I still care
She's all that matters
I still love her just like always, gotta have her
I never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care
I don't care

TITLE: Suffocating
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Pain is growing like a vine stanglin' my heart
When I think the worst is over, that's right when it starts
Someone says your name, sometimes I don't feel a thing
But then there's days like today, whoa, that are suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still suffocating
The memory of what used to be cuts me like a thorn
Loneliness starts rollin' in like thunder from a storm
My strength starts to sway, I feel the winds of change
It's such a paralyzing place, oh, and it's suffocating
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still suffocating
Let the rain wash it all away
Can't you love me another day?
I curse myself
'Cause nothing 's changed, nothing's changed
When I think it's dead and gone
Then it starts to rain, oh, and it grows again
I find myself out in your driveway
My hands are frozen on the wheel and I can feel your love still
Suffocating

Wheels turn like my memories
And the head-lights shine like my used-to-be's
And time, time's taking way too long
And forgiveness, well I hope its not too far gone
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears
Are a hundred miles from here
I, I told her I had to go
And now I know what I didn't know
And this road could lead me back to your door
But can it take me to a girl who can love me more
A hundred miles from her is where I need to be
And a hundred miles from now I'm gonna hit my knees
Say I miss you oh I love you and I'm sorry
And if she can find the way to take me back
I'll spend the rest of my life making up for the past
All my answers, all my hopes, All my fears
Are a hundred miles from here

Gas up the truck, ice up the beer
Hit up the boys and the girls
Y'all get out here (y'all get out here)
Crank up the country, Jack up the Coke
Roll up some funky, light up a smoke
Tonight we're gonna party like it's redneck '99
Gonna kick it way down at the county line
Get to sippin' on some Tennessee mountain shine

Get your bad self lit, fire up the night
Get your Friday night fix
Shoot a flame so high they could see it from town
Like we're burnin' the whole place down
Fire up the night
Yeah, walk up to that pretty little cherry bomb
Say, "what's your name, what you think about slippin' off
Gettin' lost down where the creek's still runnin'
Maybe spark up a little somethin', somethin'
Girl, you got the honey, go on and give me a taste
You're right on the money, A little whiskey shake
You're gonna break the bank"
Tonight we're gonna party like it's redneck '99
Gonna kick it way down at the county line
Get to sippin' on some Tennessee mountain shine
I think it's time to fire up the night
Get your bad self lit, fire up the night
Get your Friday night fix
Shoot a flame so high they could see it from town
Like we're burnin' the whole place down
Fire up the night (woo)

And I can't help myself

Until you're gone
Girl I know you're a gypsy soul
And I'm just a stop along your road
And you hang around long enough to blow my mind
If I had a star for every scar
You tattooed on my heart
I could fill up the Oklahoma sky
So girl I don't know why

Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found the hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Momma poured grease in a Chrisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand where
The yellow jacket's torn me up
And I ain't making this up
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it
And man, I lived it
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them old Duke boys, they're flattening their heels
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawnmower 'round
I go back there right now
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy
In a different language you might not understand
Oh, that's alright
That's just the kind of life that made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit
Back in time cos I miss it
You wouldn't know how to love it like I love it

TITLE: Cotton Pickin' Time
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
On a Mississippi mornin' 
My dad yelled out a warnin'
Son you better hit that cotton patch soon
And on my way on down the field
As I passed Old Johnson's Mill
I saw Becky Morgan, skinny dippin' nude.
Well I couldn't help but stop and stare
Hypnotized I stood right there 
Enchanted by the beauty that I'd seen 
Then she gave me a come here smile
Nearly drove my body wild 
I fell down tryin' to kick off my jeans.
Well on that cotton pickin' mornin'
I met up with Beck Morgan
You know that day I didn't get to work on time
And in the days of my December 
I know I will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
Well I lost my job that summer
But I guess I had it comin' 
Cause that pickin' cotton just wasn't on my mind
But you don't get too much money
When you got a Tupelo honey
Keepin' you cool in the Mississippi hot sunshine.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I met up with Becky Morgan
The whole dang I never got to work on time
And in the days of my December 
I know I will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
We've come along way since then
Now I own that cotton gin
And I bought that mill 
Just to make her smile 
And to keep our love from growin' old
We still go down there to that hole
Skinny dip and Becky is just as wild.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I wake up with Becky Morgan
And to this day I never got to work on time
And in the days of our December 
I know we'll will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
And every cotton pickin' mornin'
I wake up with Becky Morgan
And to this day I never got to work on time
And in the days of our December 
I know we'll will remember
Sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.
We were sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time
We were sowin' oats at Cotton Pickin' Time.

When you put two and two together
You figure out love's got four letters
I shoulda known that when I met her
But she had to spell it out for me
After all that second guessing
It's been a long hard history lesson
Hell that's a class I got an f in
But now I understand perfectly
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S-O-B in sober
She put the hang in hangover (hangover)
She put the ex in sex
She put the low in blow
She put a big F-U in my future
Yeah she's got a way
She's got a way with words
Yeah she's got a way with words
Little words like "I" and "do"
Lying, cheating, screwed
Yeah all the words I thought I knew
They got a brand new meaning now
She put the her in hurt
She put the why in try
She put the S-O-B in sober

TITLE: If I Was Your Man
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
If I was a cloud, I'd make baby raindrops
And they'd feed the treetops
If I was a cloud
If I was the sun, I'd shine on the flowers
And pass on the power
If I was the sun
If I was the moon, I'd caress every ocean
In celestial motion
If I was the moon
If I was a star, charmed and enchanted
All wishes would be granted
If I was a star
If I was your man, the kisses would linger
I'd melt in your fingers
If I was your man
If I was your man, we'd share every shower
And wash away the hours baby
If I was your man
If I was a song, I'd reach all the people
From barrooms to steeples
If I was a song
If I was a dream, I'd be sweeter than honey
I'd be bigger than money
If I was a dream
If I was your man, we'd dance through the daisies
They'd say we were crazy girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, I'd pump you with this passion
You'd get more than fashion baby
If I-I-I-I-I was your man
You would not have to hurry
I'd rub away your worries girl
If I was your man
If I was your man, then we'd be together
Now and forever baby
If I was your man
And if we were love, we'd heal every nation
We'd be on everybody's station
If we were love
If I was your man, sweet lovin' man
If I was your man
If I was your man

TITLE: Back There Again
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
This old Buick's like a needle on a compass
Pointed due west
I remember her smile like June sunflowers
And the look of her body as she slipped out of that dress
God, I'm such a mess
Never a mornin' person, but that girl's still in bed
The sheets are tanglin', her little arm is danglin'
The last dream from her pretty head
I told her I was leavin'
She didn't believe the words I said
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again
She'll put on her makeup and drink from her tea cup
Glance at that silver frame
See, I took our picture and then it'll hit her
She'll cry out with pain
Maybe, whisper my name
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again
No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Back there, again
Now, don't blame her mama for makin' me promise
Don't come around here, no more
She said, "Maybe your life's gone to hell
But, that's a tour of duty she didn't sign up for"
When you can't save yourself, you save somebody else
Maybe that's how you survive
I'm runnin' away so she don't have to see
A life in slow-motion suicide
You throw in the towel, they call you a coward
Tell ya fight, don't cut and run
I ain't no hero, but the truth is I know
It's the bravest thing I've ever done
The hardest part is knowing what we could have
Should have become
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
I ain't ever goin'
No one's gonna make me
Nothing's gonna take me
I ain't ever goin'
Goin'
To break her heart, again

TITLE: Here I Am
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
You were just someone, some friend of mine, said "Take her out" 
And have yourselves a good time 
To be honest, I was far from over a broken heart 
You were the furthest thing from my mind
You were just someone, some friend of mine, said "Take her out"
And have yourselves a good time
To be honest, I was far from over a broken heart
You were the furthest thing from my mind
And it didn't seem to matter to you
When I looked away when we were introduced
'Cause you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
And I slowly started comin' around
Now here I am
To tell the truth I did my best to tell myself
Hey, don't forget the last time
Then I stood there in disbelief
That how easily you got to me with your eyes
You reached across the table and you took my hand
I knew I was in trouble right there and then
When you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
And I slowly started comin' around
Now here I am
Down on one knee
Am I gettin' to you baby, the way you got to me?
When you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
I slowly started comin' around
Now here I am
When you broke the ice with a killer smile
Ordered us a drink and we talked a while
I slowly started comin' around
Now here I am

95.5 gets me ready to go

Drinking beer, shooting pool, man you can't go wrong

ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I never thought you'd pick up the phone
It's Friday night you should be out on the town
Didn't think you'd be sitting at home all alone like me
Nothing on TV, nothing to do
Nothing to keep my mind off you and me
And the way it was
Are you thinking 'bout it now because
I could be there in five
One more one last time
We don't have to be lonely tonight
Need you, want you, I'm right here
We don't have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight
That taste, that touch, the fire I miss
Those kiss me eyes, your red wine lips, oh my
I can use to be, baby I want you, and you want me
We don't have to be lonely tonight
Need you, want you, I'm right here
We don't have to be lonely tonight
I know we shouldn't, but I don't care
I don't wanna be right, I don't wanna be strong
I just wanna hold you till the heart breaks stone
When the sun comes up, we can both move on
But we don't have to be lonely tonight

You always get dolled up for your party
Good thing your birthday only comes once a year
'Cause you always forget that you're so small
You can't take all that alcohol
And you wind up over my shoulder and into the car
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful to me
And I don't care if your hair's a mess from the night before
Your headaches and your fussin' and cussin' the sun
The makeup you had on your face
Is now all over your pillow case
And you're curled up under the covers into a ball
But you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful to me
So, baby, don't you ever doubt
When father time starts drawing out
Those lines around your eyes
'Cause you'll always be
Yeah, you'll always be beautiful
You'll always be beautiful to me
Ya you'll always be
Always beautiful
Beautiful to me

I know nobody's perfect, but everybody is 
Sometimes the hardest work is love 
And what you're workin' with 
Lookin' in the mirror, seein' all your flaws
I know nobody's perfect, but everybody is
Sometimes the hardest work is love
And what you're workin' with
Lookin' in the mirror, seein' all your flaws
Standin' alone makes you feel so small
Mmm, don't we all?
Roses are red, violets are blue
Nothin' out there is rarer as you
Throw caution to the wind
Like a dandelion wish, go wild and free
Roses are red, violets are blue
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
The you you are that's in the dark
But you don't let them see
Show 'em all your colors
Don't worry what they think
It's the different that makes you fit
And don't you quit
Don't you forget
Roses are red, violets are blue
Nothin' out there is rarer as you
Throw caution to the wind
Like a dandelion wish, go wild and free
Roses are red, violets are blue
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
Don't smooth your edges, don't change your turn
Left the centers just right for you, for you
Roses are red, violets are blue
Nothin' out there is rarer as you
Throw caution to the wind
Like a dandelion wish, go wild and free
Roses are red, violets are blue
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
Wallflowers and weeds are beautiful, too
I know nobody's perfect, but everybody is, ooh

TITLE: All Over Me
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There was a time
I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw
She was all over me
And i used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that i love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
The sky is blue
But from where i stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What i wouldn't give if i could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again
She was all over me
And i used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that i love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
She was all over me
And i used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that i love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

TITLE: I Still Got A Finger
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Well, it must've been a hundred in that summer sun
And I've been in it all day
Putting up with that prick of an owner's son
Making me some hillbilly pay
Working right through lunch, busting my hump
Helping his daddy stay rich
So when he kept me behind to pull some overtime
I told that little son of a bitch
Hey, I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me, son
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer
Hey, I've been breaking my butt but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey, but lucky for me, you can easily see
I still got a finger that works
Yeah, I've been dragging home almost every night
'Bout the time that you're going out
Wearing something way too short and tight
Leaving me and the dog on a couch
Yeah, now word's getting 'round
You've been sneaking downtown
Dancing way too risky
Well, I got a few dirty dance moves too
And a cute little one finger wave
Hey, I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me, hon
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer
Well, I've been breaking my hump but it's never enough
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey, but lucky for me, you can easily see
I still got a finger that works
Here it comes
Hey, I've been punching your clock, giving all I got
Putting up with your pain in the rear
Adios, I'm done, you can find me, hon
Between a hottie and an ice cold beer
Hey, I've been busting my ass, you don't care about that
Ain't a part of me that doesn't hurt
Hey, but lucky for me, you can easily see
I still got a finger that works
Oh, yeah!
Yes, I do
Look at that thing
You know you're number one, baby

TITLE: Chances
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
It's 2 a.m. 
And this old bar is closing 
And he knows the partners have been chosen 
But in the corner both
It's 2 a.m.
And this old bar is closing
And he knows the partners have been chosen
But in the corner both
He spots lonely youth
And he catches her eye
Well, he moves fast
And says my name is Steven
Guess I blew my chance
Since everyone is leavin'
She stands up to go
Never says hello
But she never says goodbye
Then she smiles and
Leans her head back
Toward the door
And as she takes his hand
His jaw falls to the floor
Now, we all take chances
Every once in a while
We take chances
If it's just to ease our minds
We all take chances
Wrong or right
Oh, but sometimes chances
Take us by surprise
Morning light comes shining through her window
She wakes just in time to hear him go
She curls up in bed
Hands on her head
Tears in her eyes
She relives the night they spend together
Shouts out loud "Lord knows I knew better!"
Then she hears a sound
Slips on her gown
Takes a look outside
With coffee and flowers
He walks toward the door
And as he says, "Good morning"
Her jaw falls to the floor
Now, we all take chances
Every once in a while
We take chances
If it's just to ease our minds
We all take chances
Wrong or right
Oh, but sometimes chances
Take us by surprise
Yeah, sometimes chances
Take us by surprise
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

TITLE: A Girl
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house 
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out 
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff 
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
Had to steal, daddy's car, park it far from her house
And throwing rocks at her window til she's sneaking out
How to get a college kid to get you good stuff
Mix a perfect drink in a Sonic cup
How to lean back, fake a yawn
Stretch your arm round her shoulder
Pull her closer til she let you lean in for a kiss
How to turn a twenty into Saturday night
How to make her momma let you have her til midnight
How not to let her know she's got you caught
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout a promise and forever
All you know is nothing's better than being together
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
How to act like you're listening to her about her day
When she's talking and she's blocking the game
How to shut your mouth when it's that time of the month
Knowing when she's mad and when she's really just drunk
And you swear that you'll change all our ways
Just to get her to believe you and move into your man cave
How to hide a ring in your pocket for weeks
How to say them four words and make 'em sound so sweet
That she'd never ever say no, no no no
These are the things that you learn
When your heart just wants to burn, burn
These are the steps that you take
When you're only thinking one thing
And you don't know nothing bout living ever after
But you know you're nothing unless you get to have her
And the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Oh, you won't believe the way she's got you acting
She'll talk you into things you never thought would happen
When the only thing you want in the world, is a girl
Mm, yeah, just a girl
Just a girl, just a girl

You say you never meant to hurt me

But do you really think I should forgive you?
For what you put me through
Oh, I remember every time you said you love me
But I know now your love was just a lie
And you say you're sorry

If I could
I would dare
Feed your dreams
And starve your fears
If I could

We could sit
And watch it burn

You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, oh
If I could
Take you in
Feeling you deep
Beneath my skin
Then I could
Slip away
With you as a poison in my veins
But I don't wanna fall asleep alone
And wake up knowing that I died without the one
So tell me what I gotta do to win you over
You'll never have to wonder if you need another
You'll never have to wonder if I understand
And every time you reach for me you'll find a hand out, oh

Bearing treasures
You say these gifts are for
The new King's pleasures

All aboard
It was a big night in December, Chattanooga Tennessee
All the old folks still remember that snowy Christmas Eve
The way Santa saved that holiday, it's still hard to believe
Oh, the weather man was calling for the snow to keep comin' down
And the way that it was fallin', Rudolph never saw the ground
By Christmas day, Santa's sleigh never made it to town
Then all at once they heard that mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then comin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin' sixteen, coaches shoutin' ho ho ho
Who needs a sleigh, Santa's got a choo-choo train
Well now, he could barely hold it comin' down the hill so fast
Yeah that shiny locomotive made it town in no time flat
But you can't go slow with a Christmas load coming down the railroad tracks
When he pulled into the station and he finally shut her down
There was a big old celebration, everyone gathered 'round
They passed out toys to the girls and boys from miles around
Then all at once they heard a mighty whistle blow (ha ha)
The ground started shaken', it even shook the mistletoe
And then goin' 'round the mountain , right through the steam and smoke
Pullin', sixteen coaches shoutin' ho, ho, ho
Who needs a sleigh, when Santa's got a choo-choo train
Oh yeah, ain't need to fly away, Santa's got a choo-choo train

We'll be standin' in front of that preacher
By the time they're lookin' for us
And they'll be draggin' the river
But they ain't gonna find a thing

I'll be wearin' me a diamond ring
Ah, we're gonna show 'em
I know that it might sound crazy
Just a little bit too extreme
But to get some of your sweet lovin'
Baby, I'd do anything
Sooner or later
They'll find my letter sayin' that we're alright
We'll be rockin' at the Red Roof Inn
This time tomorrow night
And they'll be draggin' the river
Sayin', "Lord, what a cryin' shame"
They'll be draggin' the river
We'll be runnin', they'll never see it comin'
They'll be draggin' the river
They'll be draggin' the river

Sorry about callin' your dad a son of a bitch earlier
Hey, do you think he'll still hire me?
Whoa, that thing's little

Just like the ones I used to know 
Where the treetops listen 
And children listen
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops listen
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops listen
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
And may all your Christmases be white

TITLE: Came Here To Forget
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks, back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
Yeah, first of all we came here to forget
Looks like it's just me and you
Fall in love just enough to get us through
While we're getting through
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her
And with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
You better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember
Can't remember what we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
What we came here to forget
Baby, baby
That's what we came here to forget

TITLE: Savior's Shadow
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow
He is watching over me
I feel the rain, I hear the thunder
As he cries for me
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow
Grace will lead to where I'm free
I take his hand, we walk together
And his light shines on me
Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
I'm standing in my Savior's shadow
Following his footsteps there
Every mountain, every ocean
He hears my every prayer
Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
Though the devil try to break me
My sweet Jesus won't forsake me
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
Where I'm supposed to be
When I'm in my Savior's shadow
I'm who I'm supposed to be

TITLE: Underneath The Same Moon
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around
As I wander through the dark
Through the midnight mist
Remembering our last kiss
Do you know how much you're missed
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry
Dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all two distant
Hearts can do
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
Picturing your face
Flowers in your hair
Like you always wear
I can see you there
Longing to be touched
But you're out of reach
Hold on please
Won't you wait for me
Tonight I stand in this lonely place
I search the heavens
For some saving grace
And I cry
Dying without you
I know you're somewhere
Looking up there too
Right now that's all two distant
Hearts can do
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
At least we're underneath
Underneath the same moon
Shadows of the night
Moving on the ground
Like silent clouds
They follow me around

TITLE: When The Wine Wears Off
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
The keys are still hanging in the front door
You're hanging all over me
And in between kisses
I hear you whisper something 'bout loving me
There's a half a glass sitting on the table
The other half spilled on the bed
I'm halfway believing you're really meaning
Every sweet word you just said
Or is it just that bottle of red
When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room starts spinning around and 'round
Will you still be holding on
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong
Tell me will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off
When I wake up in the morning
Will you be in my arms
When the sun starts shining through those blinds
Will you mean what you said in the dark
Or will I have a headache and a broken heart
When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room starts spinning around and 'round
Will you still be holding on
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong
Tell me will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off
I don't want you to stop kissing me now
Keep on loving me laying me down
I close my eyes and hide from these doubts
Do my best to not worry about
When the wine wears off
And the buzz is gone
When the room starts spinning around and 'round
Will you still be holding on
Have we lost our minds
Or is your kiss that strong
Tell me will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off
Will you still be mine
Baby when the wine wears off

TITLE: Just South Of Heaven
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I never liked the taste of whiskey til I kissed it off of her lips
Never knew just what was hitting me, getting me tipsy
But there I sit, LevI's on a dogwood branch
Yeah, she was taking me under
I might have lost my innocence
But she was saving my soul that summer
I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven
She might have been a falling angel
Nah, I didn't care at all
I never thought a prayer could be answered
With a whispered, sweet southern drawl
Even now when I close my eyes
I see her silhouette dance on the river
The way we spent those endless nights
That's the way I could spend forever
I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven
Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine
I don't know much about eternity
Or where somebody like me's gonna wind up going
All I know is that I have already been
Parked in a Chevy by the deep river rolling
And that summer night, shooting star paradise
Might be all that I'm getting
Kissing and sipping that seven-oh-seven
Somewhere just south of heaven
Oh yeah, just south of heaven
Somewhere just beyond the Jericho line
Little white church, roll back through the pines
Down where the three cross river unwinds
If there's a heaven on Earth, man that'd be mine
Yeah, that'd be mine
Oh, just a little bit south of heaven

TITLE: What I Wouldn't Give
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Leave the radio on
Just to hear a voice other than mine
Because I can't bear
To hear the cold truth
Running through my mind
Because everything I've did wrong
Just keeps haunting me
It wont let me be
Lying here without you,
Girl I'm starting to see
Why you gave up on me
What I wouldn't give
Just to go back when
You were in my life
I'll do it right this time
What I didn't do
Was give my whole heart to you
And that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong
And ill never hold you again
Because of what I wouldn't give
It kills me to think
How much you tried to make things to work
I wouldn't listen to you
All I would do is put myself first
I took you for granted
And I pushed you away a little more each day
Somewhere inside this hell I have seen my mistakes
Oh but now its too late
What I didn't do
Is give my whole heart to you
And that's why you're gone
I know I was wrong
And ill never hold you again
Because of what I wouldn't give
Because of what I wouldn't give

Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messing around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talking you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'ma go on and take a swing

You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still loving on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden grow
You'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses

Come on. 
In my heaven there ain't no lawyers 
Don't need names on dotted lines 
Folks do buisiness like they oughta
Come on.
In my heaven there ain't no lawyers
Don't need names on dotted lines
Folks do buisiness like they oughta
A good firm handshake works just fine
We feed lawyers to the lions.
In my heaven there ain't no children
Totin' loaded guns to school
Ain't no such thing as peer pressure
Bein' who you are is cool
They still teach that golden rule.
In my heaven
We hurt no one
No lyin', cryin' nor dyin' young
No one's lonely
No one's scared
And anyone is welcomed there
In my heaven.
In my heaven I can sing like Elvis
Play guitar like BB King
Slide a fast ball past Hank Aarron
Batter, batter, batter swing
I can do most anything.
In my heaven
We hurt no one
No lyin', cryin' nor dyin' young
No one's lonely
No one's scared
And anyone is welcome there
In my heaven.
I know that it's god's decision
What my heavens gonna be
And I ain't tellin' him his business
But if he left it up to me.
Then in my heaven
There's football with no referees
In my heaven
There's never been an injury
In my heaven
Angels yodel when they sing
In my heaven
Fish'll bite most anything
In my heaven.
In my heaven.
In my heaven...

TITLE: Minimum Wage
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Yeah, I met you 'fore anybody knew my name
Playing for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an All-Star Special on our first date in a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was crying when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401K, but hey, I had you
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you, lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love, can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love, can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' with the Joneses
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bedroom apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you, lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money

TITLE: Asphalt Cowboy
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
The sun has opened up my eyes
And I don't wanna leave your side
For that lonseome road
But here I go
Climbing back behind the wheel
50 feet of chrome and steel and a load
They need in Chicago
Through the middle of the night unknown
I'm on a ride that won't let me go
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
Sometimes late at night
I see your picture by the dashboard light
And it takes me
Where I'd like to be
Wrapped up in a blanket there
Pulling ribbons from your hair and your kiss
Girl that's what I miss
Still I drive these horses through the rain and snow
This high speed rodeo is all I know
I'm an asphalt cowboy
Born to run underneath the stars
Pay no mind to my lonely heart
Just ride, ride
'Til I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Until I'm back in your arms again
I'll be out here on the wind
And I'll ride
Through the middle of the night unknown
On a ride that won't let me go (Asphalt cowboy)

Girl I've been at work all week
Fingers to the bone I need
A little hit of you and me
A little time alone
All day I've been thinking about
Quitting early, skipping out
Haulin' ass to hit the couch
And hang with you at home
We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and nowhere to go
So baby, I don't know about you, but I'm ready to roll
Yeah
Let others fool go paint the town
We'll just hold this sofa down
'Til Monday morning rolls around
I'll tell you what let's do
You go grab those tater chips
I'll whip up some party dip
And well kick back and take a trip
And sip a beer or two
We got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke
We gotta whole lot of nothing to do and no where to go
So baby, I don't know about you, but I'm ready to roll
Yeah, we got some laid back country tunes on the radio
We gonna burn all afternoon like it's something to smoke

TITLE: It Ain't Easy Bein' Me
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There ought to be a town out there
Named for how I feel
Yeah I could be the mayor down there
And say welcome to Sorryville
It won't be on a map nowhere
You might say that it doesn't exist
But if you make enough wrong turns
It'd be hard to miss
There ought to be a bridge somewhere
They could dedicate to me
I'd probably come to the ceremony
With a can of gasoline
Walk on over to the other side
And there I'd light a match
And sit and stare through the smoke and the flames
Wonderin' how I'm ever gonna get back
Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back
But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack
I had to work to be the jerk I've come to be
It ain't easy bein' me
Ought to be a side show act for freaks like me
Yeah I could be the star of the show
With my name on the marquee
In a room with a big red button that says "Do Not Touch"
And twice a day I'd mash it down
And you could watch me self-destruct
Why do I do the things I do?
Was I born this way? Am I a self-made fool?
I shoot the lights and curse the dark
I need your love but I break your heart
And I know the words that'll bring you back
But I don't say nothin' as I watch you pack

TITLE: The Wave

We were talking on a boardwalk 
We were lit up when the lights came down 
So we drifted toward the music 
And you kissed me as the sound
We were talking on a boardwalk
We were lit up when the lights came down
So we drifted toward the music
And you kissed me as the sound
Of my favorite band was playing
But I couldn't hear them 'cause my heart
Was beating loud and out of rhythm
As you drowned out all the dark
I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water
You were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave the wave the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away
We talked for a couple of hours
We got salt all over our jeans
And we laughed about forever
What the hell did that really mean
And all of a sudden thanks to you
My favorite color is blue
I never saw you coming
Sweet salvation in and I never knew
I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water
You were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave the wave the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away
I was a town closed for [?]
I was a Ferris wheel with the light burnt out
'Til you came along
When you came along
I was a boat trapped in a bottle
Dying for water
You were the ocean
I was a compass that couldn't find heaven
I didn't know how bad I was broken
I was castaway with no land
I drew a broken heart in the sand
And you were the wave the wave the wave
That washed it all
That washed it all away
Yeah you washed it all away
You were the wave the wave the wave

On the Oklahoma shore of that old red river

That river runs deep 
That current is strong
On the Oklahoma shore of that old red river
I stand right here and curse my pride.
That river runs deep
That current is strong
And the woman I love is on the other side.
How did the love we made together
Break apart and drift away
Leave me lost and lonely
On this crimson bank
Red River Blue
God pull me through
I'd walk through fire if that bridge hadn't burned in two
Texoma sky
Tears in my eyes
She said goodbye and now I'm red river blue
They say everything is bigger
Under that Texas moon
I'll bet my right hand you won't find a bigger fool
She's probably smiling somewhere tonight
In someone else's arms
I'm here dragging the muddy bottom
For pieces of my heart
Red River Blue

Grandpa's down
By the two lane
In the blazing sun
Or pouring rain
Sells tomatoes
From the back
Of his pickup truck
Reads the Bible line for line
While sipping on
Some homemade wine
That's who he is
And what he does
He's just like us
My Dad's got
A crippled hand
A casualty of Vietnam
But he's still down
At the sawmill every day
Oh and first thing
'Fore the break of dawn
Mama's got his eggs
And coffee on
My whole life
It's been that way
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
Just as sure as the river flows
We take care of our own
Step right up when someone needs a friend
Last year on the Johnson farm
A fire wiped out the house and barn
The whole town showed up
To build 'em back again, all right
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars
The living's hard
But the living's good
You see God sent
The heavens down
And hung 'em 'round
My neck of the woods
We come from
Back in the hollers
We got sweat
On our blue collars

This morning when I woke up
And man I had a bad backache
And my head felt like it took new form
Last night I stuck an ice pack where I sat on the maniac
2000 pounds of muscle and horn
I remember smilin' as we kicked up mud
Out in the bright lights
And I recall cussin' when I lost control
And he sent me on a high flight
Hey, I don't do this for the money
I don't do it for the fame
It's 'cause he threw me to the ground all bloody
That's the reason I can't walk away
I stumbled out to my pick-up
My joints popped in ten different places
One I never knew I had
I'm out here on the highway
My one track mind sticks in replay
And I start to get real mad
Seems I've lost track of all the buckles and the big checks
But I remember every time I've landed in a pile of B.S.
Hey, I don't do this for the money
I don't do it for the fame
It's 'cause he threw me to the ground all bloody
That's the reason I can't walk away, yeah
Hey, I don't do this for the money

ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Easy, easy, easy, easy 
It ain't easy, hmm 
It ain't easy 
Easy, easy, easy
Easy, easy, easy, easy
It ain't easy, hmm
It ain't easy
Easy, easy, easy
Yeah I used to be alright
Just saying goodnight
Maybe see you tomorrow
Yeah, I could go a couple of days
Just doing my thing
Whatever I wanted, but now
Your kisses hit me like lightning
Can't fight it, girl, you put it on me
Yeah, you stone me
When you ain't with me I ain't nothing but lonely
It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No I ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl, believe me
It ain't easy anymore
No, it ain't easy, that's for sure
Something different 'bout a Friday night
And the neon lights if you ain't beside me
Now I love it when you call me on the phone
Saying "hurry on home, " you got something special on
And it's just for me
Damn, you make it hard to leave
It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No, I ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl, believe me
It ain't easy leaving my baby in the bed
And driving away knowing the last thing you said
Was "don't go, don't leave, lay here with me"
Girl, you're making me crazy
It ain't easy
No, no, no, it ain't easy
It sure ain't baby, yeah baby
It ain't easy anymore
When I'm walking out your door
My feet drag across the floor
And it just about kills me
I hate picking up my keys
I hate kissing you goodbye
No I ain't gonna lie
With that look in your eyes
And your arms around me
Girl, believe me
It ain't easy anymore
No it ain't easy, walking out your door
Mmm, no it ain't easy, no, no
No, it ain't easy
Walking out your door
It ain't easy, oh, it ain't easy

TITLE: Small Town Big Time
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Yea, Hollywood Boulevard
Looking down, seeing stars
90210, Rodeo is Rodeo
Glad I hit it, glad I did it and I'd do it again
Yea, and hang with my friends
With them red Maserati's and them tuned up bodies
And everybody gonna be the next somebody
Yea, this place is a trip
Hey but meanwhile back in the stick
Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
Or keeping the buzz sipping on a little moonlight
Yea, they know how to rock
Out in the boondocks
Cause believe me I've been there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
Yea, two lane town squares
Cotton queens, county fairs
With a water tank
Got 100 girls' names under the paint
Glad I hit it, glad I did it and I'd do it again
Yea, I miss my friends
With them pick'em up trucks and them dirt road ruts
And all them country girls get to strutting their stuff
East, west, north or south
Yea you better believe, that I'm riding right now
Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
Or lighting it up with a KFC spotlight
Yea, they all got the swerve
Down back in their hometown
I wish that I was there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
Somebody's having a small town big time night
Somebody's rocking the main street with red tail lights
Somebody's cranking it up or falling in love
And twisting it up and dodging them blue lights
Yea, they know how to kick it
Way out past the limits
Cause baby I've been there
Somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
Yea, somebody's having a small town big time night, somewhere
I wish that I was there
Yea, I wish that I was there

TITLE: Who Are You When I'm Not Looking
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
Do you pour a little something on the rocks?
Slide down the hallway in your socks?
When you undress, do you leave a path?
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath?
My oh my, you're so good-looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all your cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking?
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
Do you break things when you get mad?
Eat a box of chocolates 'cause you're feelin' bad?
Do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails?
Call up momma when all else fails?
Who are you when I'm not around?
When the door is locked and the shades are down?
Do you listen to your music quietly?
And when it feels just right, are you thinkin' of me?
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
My oh my, you're so good-looking
But who are you when I'm not looking?

TITLE: Frame Of Mine
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There's a picture of you on my dresser
And it's been there since you said goodbye
And when I look in it's direction
You're starin' my heart straight in the eye
It just sits there smilin' at me
Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine
I wish I could tear it to pieces
And I've tried with all of my might
But somehow I can't find courage
Oh, to let you out of my sight
It just sits there smilin' at me
Takin' me back in time
And before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine
Yea before I know it
I'm all caught up in
That old frame of mine

TITLE: This Can't Be Good
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There's a campfire burning on the Mississippi River bank
My old pickup speakers are cranking out alot of Hank
That's the sheriff's daughter dancin' on my hood
With an empty bottle this can't be good
There's an unwritten law in this sleepy little town
There ain't no drinkin' on the river when the sun goes down
Think I see the blue lights comin' through the woods
Its the sheriff and his posse, this can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world is comin'
With a Buffard T kinda law man closin' in
She just keeps on rockin' guess I better do some talkin
She's too dumb to run n' I'm too drunk to swim
This can't be good, this can't be good, this can't be good
Aww stay tuned...
This ol' haybarn's full of last years grass
I got a whole tin can full of campfire gas
Theres a little bitty flame on this piece of firewood
And when it all comes together it can't be good
Everybody is runnin' like the end of the world was comin'
With a wildfire burnin' like a freight train outta control
She just keeps on rockin', babe there ain't no time for talking
Throw her over my shoulder run with everything I can
Hold on babe looks like were jumpin' in...
Now you know, when we get to the other side, were gonna have to take all
These wet clothes off, and hang out awhile... you know, this could be good
Yeah!

TITLE: Ten Times Crazier
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake
But I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
Well I'm all about a weekend kickin' with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinkin' that I won't leave 'em hangin'
Cause even though I'm crazy about them good ol' boys
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I know you love me girl thats easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I'm ten times crazier about your lovin' girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

TITLE: Goodbye Time
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
It's your life - you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away don't I matter anymore?
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
"Well it's been fun" - what else can I say?
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
Goodbye Baby

TITLE: Do You Remember
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Where are you now? 
Who's holdin' you now? 
When your world stands still, do you remember? 
Leaves were fallin'
Where are you now?
Who's holdin' you now?
When your world stands still, do you remember?
Leaves were fallin'
We were fallin'
Almost like a dream, do you remember?
Seasons changed
We both changed
Sometimes I go back to when
We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?
Where I am now
Is where I should be now
You're so far away, but always with me
And it seems like
Another life
Whenever I go back to when
We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?
We ran, we kissed, we learned to love, to live
We ran, put our feet in the water
We danced, didn't care who could see
We sang every song to each other
Summer would end, but not for me
I still feel the hope in your kisses
I still feel the sun on your skin
I swear I was holdin' forever back then
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

TITLE: Neon Time
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Yeah, we're just gonna
Pull up a stool, act like a fool
Nothing to do 'til Monday
We'll put a quarter in the box
We're off the clock
Yeah, man, we got it made
Yeah, I think we got a good thing going here
So turn up a song
Let it get you good and gone
And watch it all disappear
Yeah, we're living on neon time
Smoking up the room and clearing our minds
Little lean back and kick it
Little cold beer with it
Let it hit ya just right, yeah
Something 'bout the way the neon shines
It goes perfect with a Friday night
You ain't thinking 'bout nine-to-five
When you're living on neon time
I think we're gonna
Throw a couple back, fill up a tab
Talk about those good, good times
Everybody knows there ain't no lows
When you're raising 'em up high
Yeah, we're living on neon time
Smoking up the room and clearing our minds
Little lean back and kick it
Little cold beer with it
Let it hit ya just right, yeah
Something 'bout the way the neon shines
It goes perfect with a Friday night
You ain't thinking 'bout nine-to-five
When you're living on neon time, no no
Come on
Yeah, we're living on neon time
Smoking up the room and clearing our minds
Little lean back and kick it
Little cold beer with it
Let it hit ya just right, so right
Something 'bout the way the neon shines
It goes perfect with a Friday night
You ain't thinking 'bout nine-to-five
When you're living on neon time
No, you ain't thinking 'bout nine-to-five
When you're living on neon time

TITLE: One Night Girl
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Sunrise slipping through the trees and it looks so pretty in your eyes
I guess I got carried away, kept you out here all night
I hope you don't mind
By the smile I see on your face, 
I think you're havin' a good time, a good time
When I picked you up knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around all over the town
Whatever you like, girl
Ain't a way I can love you the way that I want to
In just one night girl
I know
That I'm just now getting to be somebody that you know
Kick your seat on back 'cause girl we're gonna take it real slow
We already turned last night into tomorrow
And we're just getting started
When I picked you up knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around all over the town
Whatever you like, girl
Ain't a way I can love you the way that I want to
In just one night girl
I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna do you right, girl
You ain't a one kiss kind that I won't miss
You ain't just a one night girl
When I picked you up knew it wouldn't be enough
Couldn't fit it in one night
Shoulda told you then soon as you got in
I'd be taking my sweet time
I could show you around all over the town
Whatever you like, girl
Ain't a way I can love you the way that I want to
In just one night girl
No, no

TITLE: Corn
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Yeah, you and your friends, ten years old
Sneaking Beech-Nut on back in the row
Sell it at market on Saturdays
Halloween getting lost with a girl in the maze
Throwing cobs at the cars that are passing
Sheriff comes out and you hide and you laugh
And praying for the sun, praying for the rain
Praying over muffins that your grandma made
Corn in the truck, corn in the field
Corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
Corn in a kettle, corn in a skillet
Corn in a jug, hot damn, you can feel it
Corn for the chicken, corn for the deer
Corn for as far as you can see around here
Leanin' on a fence in a Carhartt hat with a farmer's tan
Sayin', "Man, look at all that corn"
Yeah, all that corn, mm
Yeah, it ain't no wonder why you love it
You got your first kiss in a barn full of it
Drank your first beer, learned to play guitar
At a turnrow party with a tailgate bar
Farmer's daughter and a John Deere man
Saving your money, put a ring on her hand
Now you're raising more than a Silver Queen
In a little farmhouse by a field of dreams
Corn in the truck, corn in the field
Corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
Corn in a kettle, corn in a skillet
Corn in a jug, hot damn, you can feel it
Corn for the chicken, corn for the deer
Corn for as far as you can see around here
From the Ohio River to the northern plat
Every highway, byway
Hey, look at all that corn
All that corn
Yeah, corn in a bag that you toss in a hole
Corn on a hook at the end of a pole
Corn popping up at the movie in a bucket
First you gotta grow it, gotta pick it, gotta shuck it
Corn in the truck, corn in the field
Corn in the bottom of a moonshine still
Corn in a kettle, corn in a skillet
Corn in a jug, hot damn, you can feel it
Corn for the chicken, corn for the deer
Corn for as far as you can see around here
End this song the way it began
Started with a C and end with an N
Corn
Yeah, all that corn
Corn

TITLE: Money
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Ridin' rubber, rent checks, livin' on ramen 
Chappin' our ass 'cause we can't afford Charmin 
Rockin' that one-ply, one-ply 
Shakin' down the couch, found a buffalo nickel
Ridin' rubber, rent checks, livin' on ramen
Chappin' our ass 'cause we can't afford Charmin
Rockin' that one-ply, one-ply
Shakin' down the couch, found a buffalo nickel
Medium guitar pick, Burger King pickle
It's kinda petrified, petrified
Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Doors unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal
Haw, baby doll, that's alright
Hey, girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Gettin' me feelin' filthy rich
Hey, girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey, that's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Girl, I sure can't tell you've been workin' your butt off
The way you're rockin' them second-hand cutoffs
Can I talk you into takin' 'em off?
Score a little discount, 6-pack Keystone
Use a paper sack, twist a little home grown
Go on and get a Friday night on
Girl, one of these days, gonna look back laughin'
Sippin' pomegranate sake at Nobu
But, baby, 'til then I'm a have-not havin'
And everything I have's got, with you
Hey, girl, got that million dollar kiss
Know just what to do with it
Gettin' me feelin' filthy rich
Hey, girl, put that body all on me
Like I hit the lottery
Everything you do to me, honey, that's money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Dollar's worth of gas didn't even move the needle
Livin' this leave-a-penny, take-a-penny life
Doors unlocked 'cause there's nothin' left to steal

TITLE: Country On The Radio
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
You ever wondered why country songs say the same old thing,
Like a broken record skipping down on main,
Pretty girls, pickups and cut-off jeans?
You know what I mean
Dirt roads, corn rows and homemade wine
Juke joints, jumping on the county line
Heard 'em singing 'bout it a million times
But I don't mind
As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio
There's always gonna be a party out in the pines
Always gonna be a shot up highway sign
Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
From time to time
There's always gonna be people trying to run us down
Saying we ain't got nothing on a big town
I bet they'd come around
If they came on down
As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio
There's always gonna be a part of me
Kicking back in VFE
Yea, that's how it's always gonna be
As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio
Some country on the radio
As long as there's a small town
Saturday nights
Blue jean babies
Yeah, tip back your Dixie
Stealing those kisses

TITLE: Turnin' Me On
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Her kisses taste like whiskey
Burnin' through my veins
She don't know how to miss me
She hits right where she aims
Baby's got my number and she's calling me up
Knows what she's doing with a single touch
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on
Knows how to set me on fire
She's always holding the match
And when my body's beside hers
There ain't no turning back
She's Revlon red in the blackest night
Lighting up the room in the world just like
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on
Once she gets it started
Man, it's all night long
She's the needle on the vinyl
Of a midnight song
She's turning me on, turning me on
She's turning me on, turning me on
Pushing my buttons like it ain't no thing
If I'm what she wants, she gets what she wants
The neon's buzzing when she pulls that string
Turning me on like it's her job
Sometimes I think she must get off on
Turning me on, turning me on, yeah
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
Turning me on, turning me on
(Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Oooh, oooh, oooh
Turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me, turning me on
Oooh, oooh, oooh)

TITLE: Addicted
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
She says she hates to sleep alone but she'll do it tonight 
She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it ain't right 
So if he won't call, she'll survive 
And if he don't care, she'll get by
She says she hates to sleep alone but she'll do it tonight
She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it ain't right
So if he won't call, she'll survive
And if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head and cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should've told you before
She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she doesn't know which way to move
Oh no
She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
If she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard
She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge, about to fall from leaning out and in
She doesn't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool, 'cause she don't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool

TITLE: I Need My Girl

LYRICS:
I don't need another drink of Johnny Walker Red
And I don't need another drag off a Marlboro cigarette
And I don't need me telling myself everything's gonna be alright
And I don't need me lying here alone again tonight
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
I don't need those buddies of mine taking me on the town
Or a TV preacher warning me bout the road I'm going down
I don't need to let I'm Sorry not roll off my lips
And I don't need to let my pride talk me out of this
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
Like I never needed anything before
Like my life depends on you walking through that door
I need you, girl
Oh, I need you, girl
I need my girl, I need my baby
I need you, ninety miles an hour down the interstate
Headlights shining in the driveway
In my arms, and I need you right now
I don't need nothing else, baby, in this world
I just need my girl
I just need my girl
Just need my girl
I just need my girl

TITLE: She Don't Love Me
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
You know if I'd seen her comin'
I'd probably tried to hide
But I came around the corner
And she caught me by surprise
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I thought she'd say to me
Well, it was nothin' like that rainy night
She left and slammed the door
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I felt like some old neighbor
Just some guy that she once knew
And you'd never know she loved me
And I broke her heart in two
Was she hidin' her emotions
Or did she really get that strong
Right then she turned
And introduced me to her new friend John
I could tell the way he shook my hand
He'd never heard of me before
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
There was no ice cold shoulder
There was no ugly scene
She just smiled and didn't say
The things I knew she'd say to me
I guess she got so caught up in him
My memory's gone ignored
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore
I know it might sound crazy
But I don't know what hurts me more
Is it the fact that she don't love me
Or she don't hate me anymore
Not only she don't love me
She don't hate me anymore

ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
O-oh
Hey girl, hey where ya goin'?
Come back and sit back down
You look too good to be
Heading home so early now
Say you gotta work tomorrow
Got a lot on your mind
Let me buy another round
Girl, I think you and I should just
Drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl, we just need to drink on it
We can talk rocket science
Jesus or politics
How your boyfriend cheated on you
Man he sounds like such a prick
I could use another whiskey
And your Cosmo's gettin' low
While we're trying to figure out
The next place we should go
We can drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl, we just need to drink on it
This place is closing down
But I don't wanna quit
Gotta good thing going girl
Let's find out what it is
And drink on it
Your place or mine
Girl, we can drink on it
Dust off a bottle and drink on it
Feels like we're doin' something right
Let's find a corner of the night
Where you and I can just drink on it
Put our heads together and think on it
Maybe later on we can sleep on it
But for right now
Girl, we just need to drink on it
Might make a memory that we won't forget
So let's just drink on it
Mmm
Drink on it
(Sleep on it)
(We can try to sleep on it)

TITLE: Good Ole Boys
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Well every time I turn around
I see some dude dressed like a clown
Baggy pants and a cap on sideways
They don't say ma'am or sir no more
They won't even hold a door for a woman
Well it's a cryin' shame
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Must be workin' on a farm
Or out there chasin' rainbows
Are they back in Oklahoma
Or at a Texas rodeo
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Are they sittin' on an old bar stool
Tellin' lies and cuttin' the fool
Talkin' about the way it was and wishin'
Or down in Orange Beach, Alabama
Hangin' out at the Flora Bama
Headed out the pass and goin' fishin'
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Must be workin' on a farm
Or out there chasin' rainbows
Are they hidin' down in Georgia
Or at a Texas rodeo
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Are they drivin' cattle and ridin' high
Livin' life the cowboy way
Or down there on the front line
Fightin' off the bad guys
Givin' 'em hell for the good ole USA
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Must be workin' on a farm
Or out there chasin' rainbows
Are they back in Oklahoma
Or at a Texas rodeo
Tell me where did all the good ole boys go
Yeah just where the hell did the good ole boys go
I know where a few of 'em are
Down there in southern Oklahoma
There's even some down in Texas
I even saw one in New York one time
You know what I'm talkin' about ladies
Hell, I'll hold the door for ya
I'll hold your purse for ya
And I'll even go pick up
Some feminine products for ya
That's what a good ole boy'll do

TITLE: Good Country Song
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Shotgun in my daddy's truck
Eight years old and acting tough
He smiled at me and said, "You shift the gears"
He would search that FM dial
And I would count down every mile
Til the station out of Tulsa came in clear
It was old Thomas Conley on the radio
It punched me in the gut, man, it rattled my soul
I'm talking bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song
While hip-hop, rap, and rock were cool
I was in my basement getting schooled
On George and Keith and Vernon Alabama
I was learning bout those neon lights
Wasted days and wasted nights
And honky-tonks from Texas to Montana
And when my fingers found the fret board
I close my eyes and sing
I swear that beat up guitar only played one thing
I'm talking bout a good country song
Makes you smile, makes you hurt
Leaves you hanging on every word
A good country song
Makes you love, makes you leave
Raise some hell or hit your knees
All I know is I think of home
Grab my guitar and strum along
Kick on back and sip me something strong
When I hear a good country song
Yeah, it makes me think of days long gone
Miss my dad and call my mom
Run, laugh, and pray, and drink til dawn
When I hear a good country
A good old country, a good country song

TITLE: Every Time I Look At You
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Written by blake shelton & doug johnson
It brings back an old feeling
Running into you like this
I'm really not afraid of hurting
But I can't stand the awkwardness
Do I laugh
Do I cry
Do I dare look in your eyes
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you
You seem to be a bit distracted
I wish that I could feel the same
You never were too good at acting
Baby some things never change
I can't keep from letting go
It's something that I can't control
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you
You stand there looking sweet and innocent
But how can you be so cruel and confident
At my expense
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' show
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at....
Oh no, here it goes
My hands start to shake
My heart's gonna' blow
Like the day we met
To the night you said we're through
Every time I look at you
Oh yeah, every time I look at you

TITLE: Hillbilly Bone
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Oh man, you've gotta watch where you're stepping around here
Yeah I got a friend in New York City
He's never heard of Connway Twitty
Don't know nothing about grits and greens
Never been south of Queens
But he flew down here on a business trip
I took him honky tonkin' and that was it
He took to it like a pig to mud, like a cow to cud
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide it
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them genes
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Nah, you ain't gotta be born out in the sticks
With an F-150 and a 30-06,
Or have a bubba in the family tree
To get on down with me
All you need is an open mind
If it fires you up you gotta let it shine
When it feels so right that it cant be wrong
Come on, come on, come on
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them genes
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Come on y'all
We all got a hillbilly bone down deep inside
No matter where you from you just can't hide
And when the band starts banging and the fiddle saws
You can't help but hollering, Yee Haw!
When you see them pretty little country queens
Man you gotta admit that's in them genes
Ain't nothing wrong, just getting on your
Hillbilly bone-ba-bone-ba-bone-bone
Hillbilly done ba-bone ba-bone bone
Hillbilly done ba-bone ba-bone bone

ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Little by little, now babe
I've come a long, long way
Picking up the pieces
That you threw away
Did you give it up
Did I let you down
Either way, it doesn't matter
Cause I'm finally comin' 'round
I hope you find where you belong
Hello, goodbye
Life goes on
In another town, in a little place
Looking in the eyes of a pretty face
I ain't no fool
I know what she's thinkin'
I can hold her in my arms
But, I could never let her stay
Cause, love
Your sweet love
Still gets in the way
Minute by minute
I hear the voice in my heart
And make a new start
So, I think a little less
I drink a little more
Cause, all in all she's everything
That I've been waiting for
She smiles that smile
I face the fact
Love's a give and take thing
And I can't give it back

ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Sun just dropped off the face of the Earth
World just washed off a hard day's work
Band's about to kick off the night and the first song
(One, two, three, four)
There's a seven-forty-seven cutting cross the sky
Granny and her slippers kissing pa goodnight
Gonna lock down the hatch til the first butt crack of dawn
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
We the people of the midnight hour
Silver bullet proof full of whisky power
Getting louder and louder as the night rolls on
And getting drunk and stoned
We're the all night owls and the neon lighters
Liquored up lovers and bar room fighters
And we ain't slowing down
When the light weight crowd goes home
'Cause we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Yeah, don't you hate it when the night runs out of time
And you still got some moon in a jug of shine
Birds are singing and bringing on daylight
And we're just getting started
Drinking, picking, singing
Dropping our lines and hitting on strangers
If you're down, get up, if you're in, get out
Pop a top and fire up this party
Hey, hey, we're just getting started
Oh, yeah, we're just getting started

Girl, it's high time, I tell ya
No more messing around
Time to lay these cards on the table
And just throw it on out
I'm talking you and me with the same street name
Same last name, same everything
It's a real thing, a how I feel thing
So I'ma go on and take a swing
You'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses
Baby, let's get right down to business
I'll hang the pictures, you'll hang the stars
You'll pick the paint, I'll pick a guitar
Sing you a song out there with the crickets and the frogs
You'll name the babies and I'll name the dogs, yeah
You can park your car in the driveway
I'll park my truck in the grass
I'll put a little swing on the front porch
If you put a little tea in my glass
Watch the sun set from a gravel road
Kiss me in the kitchen on your tippy toes
Still loving on you when the rooster crows
Watching way more than the garden grow
You'll find the spot and I'll find the money
You'll be the pretty and I'll be the funny
You'll plant the flowers, I'll plant the kisses

TITLE: Go Ahead And Break My Heart
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I'm certainly sitting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you're really gone this time
Just when I'm about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon is rising and you're all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile
Oh no, here I go
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? 
Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
I never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I'm broken, I don't trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You've got me dreaming, got me thinking, I've got some hope
There is nobody else I wanna get to know
But I'm so scared, I don't know what to do
How did you get me so into you?
Oh no, and here I go
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Why are you waiting, is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don't you do it? 
Why don't you do it, baby?
You can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
There's your reasons
There's your cards
What are you waiting for?
The one to break my heart
Yeah, you can't tell me that we'll still be friends
And maybe someday we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don't you go ahead and break my heart?
Oh, go on and break, go on and break my heart
Go on and break, go on and break my heart

Never shares what he's thinking.
Miss Sexy Red Wine tells me at closing time
That she'll phone me
Mr. Whiskey Shot Glass watches hookers
Walk past when he's lonely.
I'm a bartender
I pour the drinkers
Laugh with the sinners
And cry with the saints
And even if they don't remember
I try to make their bar tender.
Mr. Never Does Tip says
That none of his kids ever call home
Mrs. Chews On Her Lip tells someone
She's at work on her cell phone.
Mrs. Husband Just Died always
Breaks down and cries on the weekends 
Just another long night in a
Bartender's life with some good friends.

Don't need your friends all gettin' jealous
Watching you walk in lookin' so good that you could sell it

Got a yellow back door porch party light
Got a speaker in the window playing Barry White
You and me out here swayin', star-gazin'
Gonna bring it back in, break the candles out
Get the mood turned on and the lights out
Lose a little something black and lacy in the couch at the house
At the house
Yeah, that's what it's all about
Don't need no plans, no reservations
Nobody calling me up, saying, "Where you at, man? We waiting."
We can keep it on chill (oh yeah), or get a little obnoxious
Go ahead and get your freak on, ain't nobody gonna stop us
Uh, uh, girl, just the essentials
You and me, a little Smithworks vodka
And out this residential

TITLE: She Wouldn't Be Gone
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Red roadside wild flower if I'd only picked you
Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and make her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that, maybe I
Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone, she wouldn't be gone
She warned me it was coming said if I didn't change
She was leaving
I just didn't believe she would ever really walk out,
God, I believe her now
Called her mamma, cried like a baby to her best friend
If they've seen her, they ain't sayin', they ain't sayin'
Now, I'm cursing like a fool, praying it ain't too late
All I wanna do is fix my mistakes.
Find her beg her for one more try, until then damn it I'll
Be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe
She wouldn't be gone
I wouldn't be beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeah maybe

So how'd I get up to your level
You're an angel sent from heaven down to me

I was heading in the wrong direction
I was reckless
Now I just got one question
Why me
Out of everybody baby
Why me
You could have picked anybody
Why me

What did I do
To get to be the one you gave your heart to
Walk up in a party on my arm
Who would have thought
You would wanna wake up every day beside me
Baby why me
I remember night one
Looking around for the right one
Saw you sitting there said what I'm done
And I walked over
Even though you're out of my league
You were diamonds in the sky
I was dirty on a plow
You're all-American pretty
I'm a one horse town
First smile you gave me I was thinking it then
And I'm still thinking it now
Why me
Out of everybody baby

Well the moon just came over the tree tops
And the whipper wheel started to sing
So I slipped down the hill
Got into the still
And drank til my ears started to ring
I followed a trail to through the hollow
To a shack back in the woods
Its my eighteenth birthday
Honey come out and play
It's time we got to no good
Now I aint afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I'm a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Come lay down on my bare skin rug
My dress is torn up and tattered
My daddy left a long time ago
And my hair just hangs down
I never made it to town
Momma said that's where bad people go
But me and my sister been talkin'
Shes eighteen one year older than me
She laid down with a man
I want to understand what she says
I'll never believe
'Cause I aint afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
Im a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug
Now I need a woman
And I need a man
We aint got nobody
An' we aint even kin

Lay me down on your bare skin rug

Dealin' with ya, goodbye sober

TITLE: When Somebody Knows You That Well
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Tommy's daddy kept a six pack in the fridge
We thought we were old enough to do what daddy's did.
It didn't take us long to go from drunk to really sick
When I walked in my house I stumbled just a bit.
You play it cool but its no use
Dad aint no fool and that's the truth
Chewing gum won't cover up that smell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
We lost daddy in 1999
I took care of everybody's pain, except for mine,
Then one night my wife took my face in her hands
She said, 'I think its time you cry for your old man.'
You play it cool but its no use
She aint no fool and that's the truth
And my tear drops finally fell
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
I could probably do more to help my fellow man,
But life gets busy and I hope God understands
Someday when I get time, I'll do more than my share
Funny how I'm thinkin' it sittin' in my easy chair
You play it cool but its no use,
God aint no fool and that's the truth
And he won't let you fool yourself
You can't hide one single thought
If you try you'll just get caught
When somebody knows you that well.
When somebody knows you that well...

She says she hates to sleep alone but she'll do it tonight

She says she hates to sleep alone but she'll do it tonight
She wants to grab her telephone but she knows it ain't right

And if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head and cry
From the beginning he was all anyone could have been
They were delirious with love, they were certain to win
Now he's breaking plans more and more
And he's leaving notes on her door
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down
He said I guess I should've told you before
She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in
And she doesn't know which way to move
Oh no
She wants to be fair, she couldn't say he was ever unkind
If she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself so apart
And there's no one else in her heart
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard
She says she feel like she's addicted to a real bad thing
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring
She knows she bounces like a yoyo when he pulls her strings
It hurts to feel like such a fool
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again
He doesn't need her now in all the ways that she needs him
She's on the edge, about to fall from leaning out and in
She doesn't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool, 'cause she don't know which way to move
It hurts to feel like such a fool

TITLE: A Guy With A Girl
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Sometimes I'm the guy with the boys kicking it back
Or the guy with the guitar singing on a country track
I might be the guy with an ice cold can, stirring up dust on some old farmland
When I walk into the party with you girl, you change all that
I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl, no
It's funny watchin' 'em do the way they do
They come walkin' up to me but they only wanna talk to you
And I don't blame 'em that they're hypnotized
They keep staring at your heartbreak eyes
It's like their heart starts stoppin' when you come walkin' into the room
And I turn into the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl
The guy that don't know how he got her
But he ain't never gonna let her, never gonna let her go
Woah-oh, yeah
I'm just the guy with the girl everybody wants to know
Wishin' you were there alone
Wonderin' how I ever got your little hand in mine
Lookin' over at ya like "ain't she beautiful?"
I'm invisible but I stand right there and smile
You're right beside me, oh and I see the same thing they're seein'
But I don't mind being the guy with the girl
No, I don't mind being the guy with the girl
(Guy with the girl)
Yeah, I'm just the guy with the girl
I'm always the guy with the girl
I don't mind it, baby
I don't mind it, baby
I'm always the guy with the girl

TITLE: Jingle Bell Rock
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell twist
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell rock
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go riding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell rock.

TITLE: Hangover Due
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I got some Friday jingle jangle in my pocket
Whatcha say we slip away, rock a few night moves
Spend the evening in some cozy conversations
Bartender shaking up a
Having us some good time groove
And we'll keep the party going
When they close it down at two
Me and you are hangover due
I'm just saying
Wanna wake up girl with our heads a little banging
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene
Only seeing only my jeans
And a pair of your high-heeled shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due
Lemme order you another Pinkatini number
Pretty soon or later you'll be bumming a cigarette
Getting my whiskey mixing with you tipsy little hot mess
Black dress kisses
Guess what happens next
Yeah a night we can't remember
I'm never gonna forget
Me and you are hangover due
I'm just saying
Wanna wake up with our heads a little banging
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene
Seeing only my jeans
And a pair of your high-heeled shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due
Me and you are hangover due
I'm just saying
Wanna wake up with our heads a little banging
Laying in them tangled up sheets just laughing
Trying to piece together just what the hell happened
Looking over the crime scene
Only seeing my jeans
And a pair of your high-heeled shoes
Me and you
Are hangover due
Hangover due

TITLE: Anyone Else
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Anyone else would shake my hand
Wish me luck, be proud for a friend
But a jealous guy won't share the sun
When it feels threatened by anyone
Yeah, anyone else would open the door
Helping me find what I was looking for
When you smile there's always a catch
Like I didn't earn everything I have
why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?
Cause nobody else would make me feel dumb
For being myself or needing someone
And I can't tell, are you ever sincere?
Did they treat you like this when you showed up here?
why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, whatever I've got
You want it all for yourself
Why can't you be happy for anyone else?
why do you always wanna put me down
(Hey, hey, hey) when I was cheering for you from the crowd
Whatever it is, you want it all
And you want everyone to see
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Why can't you be happy for me?

TITLE: I Don't Care
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There she was 
Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with the new guy 
And I'd heard about him 
I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
There she was
Laughin', talkin', window shoppin' with the new guy
And I'd heard about him
I heard she found him right around when we said goodbye
And I came real close and almost lost my temper
But I bit my tongue, kept my cool, 'cause I remembered-
I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind
I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again for a second there
That I don't care
Almost 10:00
Should've known his car would still be parked in her drive
Almost pulled in
Knocked on her door and gave her a piece of my mind
Oh, but I just kept on driving back to my place
Wonderin' why I went so far out of my way when-
I don't care
She don't matter
I don't love her anymore, he can have her
I don't know why it slips my mind
I tell myself all the time
Guess I forgot again for a second there
That I don't care
I got home, the light was blinkin' on that old machine
She said, "My brother's been in town, but he just left"
And I miss you, give me a ring
I still care
She's all that matters
I still love her just like always, gotta have her
I never got her off my mind, been hopin' she would call sometime
I know it's late, to be drivin' over there, but I don't care
I don't care

TITLE: On A Good Day
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
On a good day, when I think about her
I only cry a couple hundred tears
On a good day, when I can't forget about her
I can dull the pain with just a couple beers
On a good day I can even fake a smile
When somebody says I'm gonna be ok
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.
So set em up
Here's a hundred dollars keep em comin' joe (whoa whoa)
When I've had enough
Call this number and my brother
Will pour me in his car and drive me home
On a good day, I become the kind of man that even I can barely tolerate
And as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.
On a good day, I would never crash a party
Knowin' she'd be there with someone else
And on a good day, I would have stopped before I started
To make a major fool of myself
On a good day, I'd been quick enough to duck
Before her new love punched me in the face
But as you can plainly see
I'm not havin' on a good day.
Yeah I only see you joe
When I'm not havin' a good day
No I'm not havin' a good day.

TITLE: Grandaddy's Gun
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure ain't for sale
The good Lord only knows all the stories it could tell
Granddaddy's gun
He bought it new out of a Sears & Roebuck catalogue
And it shot a many shell over the top of an old bird dog
And it backed a burglar down when grandma took the safety off
Granddaddy's gun
It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun
He handed it to me on the day I turned 13
With a half-shot box of shells and a kit to keep it clean
I keep a picture in the case of that sweet old man and me
With granddaddy's gun
It's just a double barrel 12
The stock is cracked and it kicks like hell
It wouldn't mean what it means to me to no one
I can hear his voice when I put it to my shoulder
"A gun's like a woman, son it's all how you hold her"
He taught me a whole lot more than how to hunt
And one of these days I'll pass it on to my son
Granddaddy's gun
There's a long beard living on the living room wall
That I got with a box call
And granddaddy's gun
There's a shot up stop sign on 49
That me and Billy Joe took out one night
With granddaddy's gun
Granddaddy's gun
It sits above the mantle on a couple rusty nails
And it's worth a bunch of money but it damn sure ain't for sale

TITLE: Every Goodbye
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Wrong side of town on the second floor
Couple blocks down from the liquor store
I got a love seat and a couple DVD's we can watch
Or not
I can call a car it will be two minutes
'Til it's at the bar and we hop in it
It's pretty clear that we're both here to get over someone
So if you wanna come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and baby I got mine, but
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you've been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you
There's a reason that we're both here right now
And a reason everything didn't work out
We're two sets of previous relationships at the same time
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together, together
I could kill the pain that you've been in
You can be my heartbreak medicine
Proof that even dark clouds have a silver lining
Every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
I wanna start something with you
Oh baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine
But every goodbye
Can be the start of something new
Maybe that starts with me and you
We got all night
To get to know each other better
And try moving on together
Baby come over, come on
If you need a shoulder, it's on
I know you got your past and I got mine
But every goodbye

LYRICS:
I knew something was the matter
It really needed my attention
And I had planned to look into it someday
But I was busy making money
I wanted you to be proud of me
Now I wish I could turn the clock back someway
I thought there was time
I never thought that you would leave me
I always thought that I could find you
Somewhere near a phone to answer when I call
Now you have my full attention
Now you're all that I can think of
This is not what I expected at all
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
Are you even on this planet
Can you see these pretty flowers
Or am I standing here just talking to the wind
How I wish that I had told you
How I wish that I had shouted
I love you I love you I love you I love you back then
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time
I thought there was time

What's your all time high, your good as it gets
Your hands down best ever make-up sex
What's your guilty pleasure, your old go to?
Well if you ask me, mine would be you
What's your worst hangover, your best night yet?
Your 90 proof, your Marlboro Red?
The best damn thing you lucked into
That's easy girl, mine would be you
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shining, back road flying
Singing like crazy fools
Making up our own words
Laughing 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever
My finest hour, my wildest dream come true
Mine would be you
What's your double dare, your go all in?
The craziest thing you ever did?
Plain as your name in this tattoo
Look on my arm, mine would be you
Mine would be you
Sun keeps shining, back road flying
Singing like crazy fools
Making up our own words
Laughing 'til it hurts
Baby, if I had to choose
My best day ever
My finest hour, my wildest dream come true
Mine would be you
What's the greatest chapter in your book?
Are there pages where it hurts to look?
What's the one regret you can't work through?
You got it baby, mine would be you
Yeah you got it baby, mine would be you
Mine would be you
Taillights fading
Daylight breaking
Standing there like a fool
When I should've been running
Yellin' out something
To make you wanna hold onto
The best love ever
Girl, can you tell me
The one thing you'd rather die than lose?
'Cause mine would be you
Mine would be you

I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talkin' to you
Now you're standin' in the neon lookin' like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smilin' that smile that's drivin' me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hangin' on
You don't have to keep me fallin' like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
You can't shoot me down cause you've already knocked me dead
Got me fallin' apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road just as far as you wanna go
Baby, I'll do, whatever you wanna do, wanna do
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smilin' that smile that's drivin' me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hangin' on
You don't have to keep me fallin' like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standin' in the neon
Lookin' like a high I wanna be on

TITLE: The Last Country Song
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
There's a roadhouse just outside of town on a two-lane blacktop
Where all the folks come to hear country music play
And every year, the city's gettin' closer, Lord knows it won't stop
And old Hank the bartender gave us the bad news today
Yeah, he said this land was our land, but Lord, now it's their land
And we're still here, but not for long
So let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
'Til we've sung the last country song
There's three-hundred acres of cotton corn and a little bit of gravel
All bought up by a builder from downtown
Tomorrow when the Earth starts a-shakin' and the walls start to rattle
A big bulldozer's gonna take Hank's Roadhouse down
So everybody sing this land was our land, but Lord, now it's their land
And we're still here, but not for long
So let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
'Til we've sung the last country song
Will we play "Swingin'"
Or "He Stopped Loving Her Today"
It's really sad to see it end this way
This land was our land, but Lord, now it's their land
And we're still here, but not for long
So let's raise a cold one and play all the old ones
'Til we've sung the last country song
'Til we've sung the last country song
Oh, we've sung the last country song
Oh, we've sung the last country song

There's something 'bout yesterday
How fast it all flies away
I don't know what it is about a goodbye kiss
That makes you wanna stay
We were crazy then we were over
We were breaking up, making love, a runaway roller coaster
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
I still think about you
There's something in the bittersweet
The feeling of a memory
Right there in the moment
All I ever wanted was you and me
We were crying, we were wasted
We were dying when they played it
Every time I hear that song
I'm standing in the pouring rain
On your front lawn and oh-oh-oh
I still think about you oh-oh-oh
Every time I hear that song
It's like the first time it came on and oh-oh-oh

Ever since you left me I've been ridin' 'round
Crankin' up a little country gold heartbreak
Cried and dried these tears I don't know how
Much more missin' you I can take
I pray pray prayed, for a sign sign sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel
I take a shot of 'I don't care what you doing now'
Chase that one with a cold 'Screw you'
When that's done, I just might wash it down
With a big pitcher of 'Someone new'
That blond blonde blonde
At the bar bar bar
See if she wants to try and unbreak my heart heart heart
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel
When we were together
I thought life was set forever
Even though I knew better that the pain would never end
They say the night's darkest just before the dawn gets kissed
By the daybreak got down on my knees and I
Prayed, prayed, prayed, for a sign, sign, sign
Now there it is in the window
It's about time, damn time
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel
It ain't all that bright, but even though it's subtle
It's got me feeling alright, go on and make it a double
There's a neon light at the end of the tunnel, tunnel, tunnel

I've always been the kind of man who 
Doesn't believe in strings 
Long term obligations are just unnecessary things 
But girl you've got me thinkin', while I'm drinking one more beer
I've always been the kind of man who
Doesn't believe in strings
Long term obligations are just unnecessary things
But girl you've got me thinkin', while I'm drinking one more beer
If I'm headed for a heartache, then why the hell am I still here
I'm testin' my resistance and its wearin' mighty thin
I got the feelin' I should leave before the roof caves in
My mind tells me to move along but my body begs me stay
And now I feel the need to hold you close and love the night away
While you're turnin' me
Every which way but loose
You turn me every which way but loose
Inside the fire's burnin' me
In mind you just keep turnin' me
Every which way but loose
Baby there's no excuse
To turn me every which way but loose
When the sun comes up in the mornin' it should find me someplace new
But right this minute all I want is to lay here next to you
Those memories still keep callin' me from somewhere in my past
Better hurry if they want me cause I can feel me fading fast
While you're turnin' me
Every which way but loose
You turn me every which way but loose
Inside the fire's burnin' me
In mind you just keep turnin' me
Every which way but loose
Baby there's no excuse
To turn me every which way
Every which way but loose

Inside the fire's burnin' me
In mind you just keep turnin' me
Every which way but loose
Baby there's no excuse
To turn me every which way but loose

You look through me like I'm not even there

And I'm no quitter but I'm tired of fighting

Don't want to lose you
Don't make me let you go
Took such a long time for me to find you
Don't make me let you go
Baby, I'm begging please
And I'm down here on my knees
I don't want to have to set you free
Don't make me
What if when I'm long gone it dawns on you, you just might want me back?
Let me make myself clear
If I leave here its done, I'm gone, that's that
You carry my love around
Like it's a heavy burden
I'm about to take it back
Are you sure it's worth it?

Don't want to lose you

TITLE: Bible Verses
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I ain't ever worn a halo
Don't suppose I ever will
As far as savin' me goes
It's a battle up a hill
But I keep climbin', tryin', fightin'
Got a King James in the dresser
And I take it out sometimes
But Lord knows, I ain't measured up to what's inside
They say, but that's okay
But I keep prayin' for the day
That I can open up that good book
And Heaven don't look like it's out of reach
When it feels like those apostles are giving me the gospel
And not the third degree
I just want it to read
Like Bible verses and not the Bible versus me
I woke up in last night's clothes
And it's whiskey on my lips
If God's lookin' down, I know
He's really lookin' down on this
But I have faith that I can change
I keep prayin' for the day
That I can open up that good book
And Heaven don't look like it's out of reach
When it feels like those apostles are giving me the gospel
And not the third degree
I just want it to read
Like Bible verses and not the Bible versus me
I'm just tryin' to give myself a little grace
'Til those words and me get on the same page
And I can open up that good book
And Heaven don't look like it's out of reach
When it feels like those apostles are giving me the gospel
And not the third degree
I just want it to read
Like Bible verse and not the Bible versus me

TITLE: Got A Little Country
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Yup, yup, wooo
Time by lady rolex
Body by Bowflex
Hair by Hollywood salon
Bag by Louis Vuitton
High heels, Manolo Blahniks
Tanqueray gin and tonics
Sunglass by Gucci
Never been to Chattahoochee
She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country in her
Ah yeah
Friday, soho
That's where all the cool, cool people go
Shake your pelvis
That's how you get behind the velvet
Disco at the air bar
But what I really miss is a guitar
With a whammy bar
Going wah, wah, wah, wah
She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her
Ah, hang on!
She's got a little country, got a little country
I said, she's got a little country, got a little country in her
Got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country
Giddy up!
She's runnin' with the big dogs, she's livin' on the high hog
We're rolling in the hay every night
She's even saying yeehaw ridin' that hillbilly seesaw
We're having us a ball and holding on tight
She may look like New York, Miami, L.A.
But when it comes to lovin' me, she ain't that way
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
Got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country
She got a little country, got a little country, got a little country in her
Yup, yup
Hang on!
That's country right there
Yeehaw!
Wooo!

TITLE: Boys 'Round Here
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Well the boys 'round here don't listen to The Beatles
Run ole Bocephus through a jukebox needle
At a honky-tonk, where their boots stomp
All night; what? (That's right)
Yea, and what they call work, digging in the dirt
Gotta get it in the ground 'fore the rain come down
To get paid, to get the girl
In your 4 wheel drive (A country boy can survive)
Yea the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Aw heck
Red red red red red red redneck
Well the boys 'round here, they're keeping it country
Ain't a damn one know how to do the dougie
(You don't do the dougie?) No, not in Kentucky
But these girls 'round here yep, they still love me
Yea, the girls 'round here, they all deserve a whistle
Shakin' that sugar, sweet as Dixie crystal
They like that y'all and southern drawl
And just can't help it cause they just keep fallin'
For the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust
The boys 'round here
Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit
Let me hear you say
(Ooh let's ride)
(Ooh let's ride)
Down to the river side
Hey now girl, hop inside
Me and you gonna take a little ride to the river
Let's ride (That's right)
Lay a blanket on the ground
Kissing and the crickets is the only sound
We out of town
Have you ever got down with a...
Red red red red red red redneck?
And do you wanna get down with a...
Red red red red red red redneck?
Girl you gotta get down
With the boys 'round here
Drinking that ice cold beer
Talkin' 'bout girls, talkin' 'bout trucks
Runnin' them red dirt roads out, kicking up dust

Sending up a prayer to the man upstairs
Backwoods legit, don't take no sh*t
Chew tobacco, chew tobacco, chew tobacco, spit

TITLE: Can't Afford To Love You
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
I saw you sittin' there sippin' red wine down at Causen Mills
I knew you'd prob'ly be outta my league but I though, what the hell?
Aw, what the hell
Five dollars a glass was kickin' my butt but I kept on buyin'
I kinda thought you were into me
So I kept on tryin' to get them sparks a'flyin'
In my forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
All I had to my name was a big ol' truck and a little ol' place
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoo-hoo-hoo
I asked you if you ever stared up at the stars from a tailgate
Down by the river with a six pack
You said no, but it sure sounds great
You climbed up in my old truck
Sittin' right beside me
I cranked up a country song
And you started smilin'
Yeah, this ol' boy was stylin'
In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
I missed work for three days
Kissin' on you, didn't get paid
I couldn't help but think
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not to
Hoo-hoo-hoo
We been together ever since that night
You're still in love with that same old guy
That same old guy, old guy
In forty dollar blue jeans
Next to a beauty queen
Used to the finer things
Yeah, we set a date for next spring
Workin' two jobs, pickin' out rings
I can't help but think
I can't afford to love you
I can't afford to love you
But I can't afford not too
Hoo-hoo-hoo
I can't afford not too
Love on you

ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man"
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
We'll pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man"
But you can do the job when you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

TITLE: Ol' Red
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Well, I caught my wife with another man
And it cost me ninety-nine
On a prison farm in Georgia
Close to the Florida line
Well, I'd been here for two long years
I finally made the warden my friend
And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
Takin' care of Ol' Red
Now, Ol' Red, he's the damnedest dog 
That I've ever seen
Got a nose that can smell a two-day trail
He's a four legged tracking' machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky
To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red
And the warden sang
Come on somebody, why don't you run?
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern, get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'fore the mornin' comes
Well, I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bout a mile just south of the gate
And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang
Come on somebody, why don't you run?
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern, get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'fore the mornin' comes
Now Ol' Red got real used to seein'
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited 'til the time got right
Well, I made my run with the evening sun
And I smiled when I heard 'em turn Red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south
And the warden sang
Come on somebody, why don't you run?
Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
Get my lantern, get my gun
Red'll have you treed 'fore the mornin' comes
Now there's red-haired blue ticks all in the South
Love got me in here and love got me out

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks 
Dressed in holiday style 
In the air there's 
A feeling of Christmas
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air there's
A feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all the bustle you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, ring-a-ling
Hear them ring, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

You get waxed, you get shaved
You get high

Forget your next line
You get drive thru

You get the girl, you get the one
You get her home, you get her done
You get hitched, you get mad
She gets a lawyer, she gets half
You get banged up

TITLE: God's Country
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
Right outside of this one church town
There's a gold dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land, but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, and thank Him when it's fallen
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate
I guess that's why they call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again
'Cause we're proud to be from God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The Devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (yeah)
God's country
I don't care what my headstone reads
Or what kind of pinewood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)
Yeah, I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in a 40 on the muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs runnin'
Saved by the sound of the been found

Oh you hate to be tied down

If time has no end and if time has no end  
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity  
A circle an eternal loop  
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
If time has no end and if time has no end 
A billion years a trillion years what then is infinity 
A circle an eternal loop 
It can drive you crazy searching for the truth
Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 
Before we were babies 
There's nothing we recall and when we go back 
Will it fade to black and that's all 
Or could we be destined for some other time and place 
And have we lived other lives our memories have erased
Someday will we know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it 
Someday 
Will we see Jesus comin' as the sunshine fills the night 
Or when we die will we fly into the light 
Will we all be reunited with the ones who've gone away 
And will we love each other the way we do today I believe 
Someday we'll know all about it 
Have no reason to doubt it

TITLE: Austin
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
She left without leavin' a number
Said she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
'Cause she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got
If your callin' 'bout the car I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowlin'
If you've got somethin' to sell your wastin' your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else wait for the tone you know what to do
And P.S., if this is Austin, I still love you
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then
If it's Friday night I'm at the ball game
And first thing Saturday if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake and I'll be gone all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home on Sunday afternoon
And P.S., if this is Austin, I still love you
Well this time she left her number
But not another word
When she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard
If your callin' 'bout my heart it's still yours
I should have listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way boy this is no machine your talkin' to
Can't you tell, this is Austin, and I still love you
I still love you

And it was on, eyes locked, clock stopped
One little kiss, no, we never meant to start falling in love
Oh man, you can't make this up
Then I walked you out to your car, it wouldn't start cause you left on your lights
Then you just shook your head and laughed and said "I guess I need a ride"
Then come to find out your house was just a block from mine
Yeah this is one of those movie scene cool kinda things where the stars align
Just an hour ago...

I know you'd be happy with who I used to be
But he's gone, gone, gone, I'm moving on, so long
You gotta roll with the flow 'til the flow don't roll no more
You gotta know when to hold, when to fold, when to hit the road
And when to stay the course
You gotta learn to bend or the difference in a little rain and a raging storm
You gotta roll with the flow 'til the flow don't roll no more
Then roll on out the door
I've been swimming right upstream
Wondering how much brass is left on that ring
And when is last call really your last drink
I thought you go as long as it takes
But how many fools can one drink make
With so many cracks in a heart, what's one more break
You gotta roll with the flow 'til the flow don't roll no more
You gotta know when to hold, when to fold, when to hit the road
And when to stay the course
You gotta learn to bend or the difference in a little rain and a raging storm
You gotta roll with the flow 'til the flow don't roll no more
Then roll on out the door
If you need me, I'm gone, gone, gone

Pour me another tequila, Sheila!
Pour me another tequila, Sheila
Take off that red satin dress
I crossed the border, and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez
I feel like ol' Poncho Villa, Sheila
And I got the pesos to spend
So pour me another tequila, Sheila
And lay down and love me again
No, I can't tell you about it
But don't mind my gun by the bed
I feel kinda naked without it
And it eases the fears in my head
So just pass me the salt and the lemon
Bend down and blow out the lights
I never have trusted the women
Oh, but Sheila, I'll trust you tonight
So pour me another tequila, Sheila
And take off that red satin dress
I crossed the border, and I beat the dealer
For all the damn gold in Juarez
I feel like ol' Poncho Villa, Sheila
And I sure could use me a friend
So pour me another tequila, Sheila
And lay down and love me again
Shelia, I'm hearin' your heart beat
But I'm hearin' footsteps outside
The courtyard is crawlin' with them federales
And Sheila, there's no place to hide
I don't know who could've tipped 'em
'Cause nobody knew it but you
And I can't make love to a squealer, Sheiler
So I guess there's just one thing to do
So pour me another tequila, Sheila
I'm gonna put on your red satin dress
Now you put on my clothes and you go out and face the dealer
Sheila, I'll wish you the best
I feel like ol' Poncho Villa, Sheila

I wanna say it now, wanna make it clear
For only you and God to hear
I don't wanna live without you (I don't wanna live)
I don't wanna even breathe
I don't wanna dream about you
Wanna wake up with you next to me (Next to me)
I don't wanna go down any other road now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (I don't wanna love nobody)
Lookin' in your eyes now, if I had to die now
I don't wanna love nobody but you (You)
I don't wanna love nobody (You)
I don't wanna love nobody but you

TITLE: I Have Been Lonely
ARTIST: Blake Shelton
LYRICS:
You told me I'd regret it 
On the day I left you 
I had the nerve to laugh 
As I walked away
You told me I'd regret it
On the day I left you
I had the nerve to laugh
As I walked away
Well, its been six months
And eighteen days
Feelin' nothin' but This empty pain
And I just had to tell you
Even if there's nothin'
Left to say
I felt the burnin' on the hurtin' side
Of a love that didn't work out right
The empty longin' on a long cold night
I have been lonely
I've leaned on no one when the times got tough
When it comes to heartaches lord I've had enough
Know what it's like to live without your love
I have been lonely
I was gonna show you
That I didn't need you
Now I need to show you I was wrong
Here I am knees to the floor
I don't wanna live like this no more
I'm heartbeat in misery
Now all my pride is gone
I felt the burnin' on the hurtin' side
Of a love that didn't work out right
The empty longin' on a long cold night
I have been lonely
I've leaned on no one when the times got tough
When it comes to heartaches lord I've had enough
Know what it's like to live without your love
I have been lonely
I have been lonely
I have been lonely
